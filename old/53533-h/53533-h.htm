<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE RED JEWEL.</p>


<p>Craft and greed showed in the eyes of the hatchet-faced
Chinaman. He seemed to have been in deep slumber
in the car seat, but the drowsiness was feigned. The
train was not five minutes out of the town of Catskill
before he had roused himself, wary and wide-awake, and
looked across the aisle. His look and manner gave evidence
that he was meditating some crime.</p>

<p>It was in the small hours of the morning, and the passenger
train was rattling and bumping through the heavy
gloom. The lights in the coach had been turned low,
and all the passengers, with the exception of the thin-visaged
Celestial, were sprawling in their uncomfortable
seats, snoring or breathing heavily.</p>

<p>Across the aisle from this criminally inclined native of
the Flowery Kingdom was another who likewise hailed
from the land of pagodas and mystery; and this other, it
could be seen at a glance, was a person of some consequence.</p>

<p>He was fat, and under the average height. Drawn
down over his shaven head was a black silk cap, with a
gleaming red button sewn in the centre of the flat crown.
From under the edge of the cap dropped a queue of
silken texture, thick, and so long that it crossed the
Chinaman's shoulder and lay in one or two coils across
his fat knees.</p>

<p>Yellow is the royal color in China, and it is to be noted
that this Celestial's blouse was of yellow, and his wide
trousers, and his stockings&mdash;all yellow and of the finest
Canton silk. His sandals were black and richly embroidered.</p>

<p>From the button and the costume, one at all informed
of fashions as followed in the country of Confucius might
have guessed that this stout person was a mandarin.
And that guess would have been entirely correct.</p>

<p>To go further and reveal facts which will presently
become the reader's in the logical unfolding of this chronicle,
the mandarin was none other than Tsan Ti, discredited
guardian of the Honam joss house, situated on
an island suburb of the city of Canton. He of the slant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
lawless gleaming eyes was Sam Wing, the mandarin's
trusted and treacherous servant.</p>

<p>A Chinaman, like his Caucasian brother, is not always
proof against temptation when the ugly opportunity presents
itself at the right time and in the right way. Sam
Wing believed he had come face to face with such an
opportunity, and he was determined to make the most
of it.</p>

<p>Sam Wing was a resident of San Francisco. He
owned a fairly prosperous bazaar, and, once every year,
turned his profits into Mexican dollars and forwarded
the silver to an uncle in Canton for investment in the
land of his birth. Some day Sam Wing cherished the
dream of returning to Canton and living like a grandee.
But wealth came slowly. Now, there in that foreign
devil's choo-choo car such a chance offered to secure
unheard-of riches that Sam Wing's loyalty to the mandarin,
no less than his heathen ideas of integrity, were
brushed away with astounding suddenness.</p>

<p>Tsan Ti slept. His round head was wabbling on his
short neck&mdash;rolling and swaying grotesquely with every
lurch of the train. The red button of the mandarin's
cap caught the dim rays of the overhead lamps and threw
crimson gleams into the eyes of Sam Wing. This flashing
button reminded Sam Wing of the red jewel, worth
a king's ransom, which the mandarin was personally conveying
to San Francisco, en route to China and the city
of Canton.</p>

<p>Already Sam Wing was intrusted with the mandarin's
money bag&mdash;an alligator-skin pouch containing many oblong
pieces of green paper marked with figures of large
denomination. The money was good, what there was of
it, but that was not enough to pay for theft and flight.
Sam Wing's long, talon-like fingers itched to lay hold of
the red jewel.</p>

<p>With a swift, reassuring look at the passengers in the
car, Sam Wing caught at the back of the seat in front
and lifted himself erect. He was not a handsome Chinaman,
by any means, and he appeared particularly repulsive
just at that moment.</p>

<p>Hanging to the seat, he steadied himself as he stepped
lightly across the aisle. Another moment and he was at
the mandarin's side, looking down on him.</p>

<p>Tsan Ti, in his dreams, was again in Canton. Striding
through the great chamber of the Honam joss house,
he was superintending the return of the red jewel to the
forehead of the twenty-foot idol, whence it had been
stolen.</p>

<p>While the mandarin dreamed, Sam Wing bent down
over him and, with cautious fingers, unfastened the loop
of silk cord that held together the front of the yellow
blouse. The rich garment fell open, revealing a small
bag hanging from the mandarin's throat by a chain.</p>

<p>Swiftly, silently, and with hardly a twitch of the little
bag, two of Sam Wing's slim, long-nailed fingers were
inserted, and presently drew forth a resplendent gem,
large as a small hen's egg.</p>

<p>A gasping breath escaped Sam Wing's lips. For a
fraction of an instant he hesitated. What if his ancestors
were regarding him, looking out of the vastness of
the life to come with stern disapproval? A Chinaman
worships his ancestors, and the shades of the ancient
ones of his blood have a great deal to do with the regulating
of his life. What were Sam Wing's forefathers
thinking of this act of vile treachery?</p>

<p>The thief ground his teeth and, with trembling hands,
stowed the red jewel in the breast of his blouse. He
started toward the rear door of the car&mdash;and hesitated
again.</p>

<p>Sam Wing was a Buddhist, as the Chinese understand
Buddhism, wrapping it up in their own mystic
traditions. This red jewel had originally been stolen
from a great idol of Buddha. In short, the jewel had
been the idol's eye, and the idol, sightless in the Honam
joss house, was believed to be in vengeful mood because
of the missing optic. The idol had marshalled all
the ten thousand demons of misfortune and had let them
loose upon all who had anything to do with the pilfering
of the sacred jewel.</p>

<p>Who was Sam Wing that he should defy these ten
thousand demons of misfortune? How could he, a miserable
bazaar man, fight the demons?</p>

<p>But his skin tingled from the touch of the red jewel
against his breast. He would dare all for the vast wealth
which might be his in case he could "get away with the
goods."</p>

<p>Closing his eyes to honor, to the ten thousand demons,
to every article of his heathen faith, he bolted for the
rear of the car. Opening the door, he let himself out on
the rear platform. A lurch of the car caused the door to
slam behind him.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Tsan Ti had continued his delightful
dreaming. His subconscious mind was watching the
priests as they worked with the red jewel, replacing it in
the idol's forehead. The hideous face of the graven
image seemed to glow with satisfaction because of the
recovery of the eye.</p>

<p>The priest, at the top of the ladder, fumbled suddenly
with his hands. The red jewel dropped downward, with
a crimson flash, struck the tiles of the floor, and rolled
away, and away, until it vanished.</p>

<p>A yell of consternation burst from the mandarin's lips.
He leaped forward to secure the red jewel&mdash;and came to
himself with his head aching from a sharp blow against
the seat back in front.</p>

<p>He straightened up, and the alarm died out of his
face. After all, it was only a dream!</p>

<p>"Say!" cried a man in the seat ahead, turning an
angry look at Tsan Ti. "What you yellin' for? Can't
a heathen like you let a Christian sleep? Huh?"</p>

<p>"A million pardons, most estimable sir," answered
Tsan Ti humbly. "I had a dream, a bad dream."</p>

<p>"Too much bird's-nest soup an' too many sharks' fins
for supper, I guess," scowled the man, rearranging himself
for slumber. "Pah!"</p>

<p>Tsan Ti peered across the aisle. The seat occupied by
his servant, Sam Wing, was vacant. Sam Wing, the
mandarin thought, must have become thirsty and gone
for a drink.</p>

<p>The mandarin heaved a choppy sigh of relief. How
real a dream sometimes is! Now, if he&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>His hand wandered instinctively to the breast of his
blouse, and he felt for the little lump contained in the bag
suspended from his throat.</p>

<p>He could not feel it. Pulling himself together sharply
Tsan Ti used both hands in his groping examination.</p>

<p>Then he caught his breath and sat as though dazed. A
slow horror ran through his body. His blood seemed
congealing about his heart, and his yellow face grew
hueless.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>

<p>The red jewel was gone! The front of his blouse was
open!</p>

<p>Then, after his blunted wits had recovered their wonted
sharpness, Tsan Ti leaped for the aisle with another yell.</p>

<p>"Say," cried the man in the forward seat, lifting himself
wrathfully, "I'll have the brakeman kick you off the
train if you don't hush! By jing!"</p>

<p>The mandarin began running up and down the aisle of
the car, wringing his fat hands and yelling for Sam
Wing. He said other things, too, but it was all in his
heathen gibberish and could not be comprehended.</p>

<p>By then every person in the car was awake.</p>

<p>"Crazy chink!" shouted the man who had spoken before.
"He's gone dotty! Look out for him!"</p>

<p>At that moment the train lumbered to a halt and the
lights of a station shone through the car windows. The
brakeman jammed open the door and shouted a name.</p>

<p>"Motor Matt!" wailed Tsan Ti. "Estimable friend,
come to my wretched assistance!"</p>

<p>"Here, brakeman!" cried the wrathful passenger who
had already aired his views, "take this slant-eyed lunatic
by the collar of his kimono and give him a hi'st into the
right of way. Chinks ought to be carried in cattle cars,
anyhow."</p>

<p>Tsan Ti, however, did not wait to be "hoisted into the
right of way."</p>

<p>With a final yell, he flung himself along the aisle and
out the rear door, nearly overturning the astounded
brakeman. Once on the station platform, he made a bee
line for the waiting room and the telegraph office.</p>

<p>There was but one person in all America in whom the
mandarin had any confidence, but one person to whom
he would appeal. This was the king of the motor boys,
who, at that moment, was in the town of Catskill.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">ANOTHER END OF THE YARN.</p>


<p>On the same night this Oriental treachery manifested
itself aboard the train bound north through the Catskills,
a power yacht dropped anchor below the town of Catskill.</p>

<p>There was something suspicious about this motor
yacht. She carried no running lights, and her cabin ports
were dark as Erebus. She came to a halt silently&mdash;almost
sullenly&mdash;and her anchor dropped with hardly a
splash. A tender was heaved over the side, and four
men got into it and were rowed ashore by one of their
number. When the tender grounded, three of the passengers
got out. One of them turned to speak to the
man who remained in the boat.</p>

<p>"Leave the tender in the water, when you get back to
the <i>Iris</i>, Pierson. If the tender is wanted here, a light
will be shown."</p>

<p>"All right, Grattan," answered the man in the boat,
shoving off and rowing noiselessly back to the yacht.</p>

<p>"Hide the lantern in that clump of bushes, Bunce,"
went on Grattan.</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, messmate," answered the person addressed as
Bunce.</p>

<p>"Look here, Grattan," grumbled the third member of
the party, "Motor Matt has cooked our goose for us, and
I'll be hanged if I can see the use of knocking around
the town of Catskill."</p>

<p>"There are a lot of things in this world, Pardo," returned
Grattan dryly, "that are advisable and that you
haven't sense enough to see."</p>

<p>Pardo muttered wrathfully but indistinctly.</p>

<p>"Now," proceeded Grattan, "this is the way of it: We
got Motor Matt and his chum, McGlory, aboard the <i>Iris</i>&mdash;lured
them there on the supposition that Tsan Ti had
sent Motor Matt the red jewel to keep safely for him for
a time. Motor Matt and McGlory walked into our trap.
We got the red jewel and put the two boys ashore some
fifteen or twenty miles below here. Half an hour later
I put the supposed ruby to some tests and found it was
counterfeit&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Are you sure the ruby you stole from the Honam joss
house was a true gem?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Tsan Ti sent Motor Matt a counterfeit replica
for the purpose of getting us off the track. Motor Matt
and McGlory will take the first train for Catskill from
the place where we put them ashore. We'll lie in wait
for them on the path they must take between the railroad
station and their hotel. It's a dark night, few passengers
will arrive at this hour, and we can recapture the two
motor boys and take them back to the <i>Iris</i>."</p>

<p>"What good will that do?" demurred Pardo. "Motor
Matt hasn't the real stone&mdash;Tsan Ti must have that."</p>

<p>"I'll find out from Motor Matt where Tsan Ti is,"
said Grattan, between his teeth, "and then I'll flash a
message to the mandarin that he must give up the real
gem, or Motor Matt <i>will suffer the consequences</i>!"</p>

<p>"You can't mean," gasped Pardo, in a panic, "that you
will&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's a bluff, that's all," snapped Grattan. "It will
scare the mandarin out of his wits. Have you hid the
lantern, Bunce?" he demanded, as the other member of
the party came close.</p>

<p>"Ay, Grattan," was the reply. "First bunch of bushes
close to where we came ashore."</p>

<p>"All right; come on, then. I've figured out what train
Motor Matt and Joe McGlory will catch, and it should
soon be at the depot."</p>

<p>With Grattan in the lead, the party scrambled up the
slope through the darkness, passed some ice houses,
crossed a railroad track, and finally came to a halt in a
lonely part of the town, near the walk leading from the
railroad station to the business street and the hotels. A
billboard afforded them a secure hiding place.</p>

<p>Grattan had figured the time of the train pretty accurately.
He and his companions waited no longer than
five minutes before the "local" drew to a halt at the
station.</p>

<p>"If those boys are not on the train," muttered Pardo,
"then we're fooled again. Confound that Motor Matt,
anyhow!"</p>

<p>"He has my heartiest admiration," returned Grattan,
"but I'm not going to match wits with him and call myself
beaten. Hist!" he added abruptly, "here come two
people&mdash;and maybe they're the ones we're looking for.
Mind, both of you, and don't make a move till I give
the word."</p>

<p>Breathlessly the three men waited. Footsteps came
slowly up the walk and voices could be heard&mdash;voices
which were recognized as belonging to the motor boys.</p>

<p>"Well, pard," came the voice of McGlory, "New York<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
for ours in the morning. Tsan Ti, with the big ruby, is
on the train, bound for China and heathen happiness,
Grattan has the bogus stone and is making himself absent
in the <i>Iris</i>, and you and I are rid of the hoodoo at last,
and have fifteen hundred to the good. That's what I
call&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>By then the two lads had passed the billboard and were
so far away that spoken words could not be distinguished.
And Grattan had given no word for an attack!</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you, Grattan?" whispered
Pardo. "They're too far off for us to bag them now."</p>

<p>"We're not going to bag them." Grattan was a man
of quick decisions. "We've changed our plans."</p>

<p>While the other two mumbled their surprise and asked
questions, Grattan had taken pencil, notebook, and an
electric torch from his pocket. Snapping on the torch,
he handed it to Bunce.</p>

<p>"Put a stopper on your jaw tackle and hold that," said
he crisply.</p>

<p>Then he wrote the following:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Conductor, Local Passenger, North Bound</span>: Fat
Chinaman, answering to name of Tsan Ti and claiming
to be mandarin, on your train. He's a thief and has
stolen big ruby called Eye of Buddha. Put him off train
in charge of legal officer, first station after you receive
this. Answer.</p>

<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">James Philo</span>, Detective."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>"This is a telegram," said Grattan, and read it aloud
for the benefit of his two companions. "You'll take it
down to the railroad station, Pardo," he went on, "and
have it sent at once to the nearest point that will overtake
the train Matt and McGlory just got off of. Bunce
and I will wait here, and you stay in the station till you
receive an answer."</p>

<p>"But how do you know Tsan Ti is on that train?"
asked Pardo.</p>

<p>"Didn't you hear what was said when the motor boys
passed us?"</p>

<p>"But nothing was said about the mandarin being on
<i>that</i> particular train."</p>

<p>"I'm making a guess. If the conductor replies that
no such chink is on the train, then my guess is wrong.
If he answers that the chink was there, and that he has
put him off, red jewel and all, into the hands of the
legal authorities, then James Philo Grattan will play the
part of James Philo, detective, and fool these country
authorities out of their eye teeth&mdash;and, incidentally, out
of the Eye of Buddha."</p>

<p>The daring nature of Grattan's hastily formed plan
caused Pardo and Bunce to catch their breath. Grattan
was a fugitive from the law, and yet here he was making
the law assist him in stealing the red jewel for the
second time!</p>

<p>"You're a wonder," murmured Pardo, "if you can
make that game work."</p>

<p>"Trust me for that, Pardo. Now you hustle for the
railroad station and get that message on the wires.
Hurry back here as soon as you receive an answer."</p>

<p>Pardo took the paper and made off down the slope.
He was gone three-quarters of an hour&mdash;a weary, impatient
wait for Bunce, but passed calmly by Grattan.</p>

<p>When Pardo returned he came at a run.</p>

<p>"Your scheme's no good, Grattan!" were his first
breathless words.</p>

<p>"Why not?" demanded Grattan. "Wasn't Tsan Ti on
the train?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;and another chink, as well. Fat Chinaman,
though, jumped off at Gardenville, first station north of
Catskill. Here, read the conductor's message for yourself."</p>

<p>Grattan, still cool and self-possessed, switched the
light into his torch and read the following:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Two Chinamen, one answering description, came
through on train from Jersey City. Fat Chinaman
jumped off at Gardenville, although had ticket reading
Buffalo. Don't know what became of other Chinaman.
Two young men boarded train River View, talked with
fat Chinaman, got off Catskill.</p>

<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Conductor.</span>"<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>Grattan must have been intensely disappointed, but he
did not give rein to his temper. While Bunce spluttered
and Pardo swore under his breath, Grattan was wrapped
in profound thought.</p>

<p>"We'll have to change our plans again," he observed
finally. "We gave over the idea of capturing Motor
Matt and McGlory for the purpose of getting Tsan Ti
held by the authorities as a thief; now we've got to give
that up. Why did Tsan Ti get off the train at Gardenville
when he was going to Buffalo? It was an Oriental
trick to pull the wool over my eyes. The mandarin is
afraid of me. We must proceed at once to Gardenville
before Tsan Ti has a chance to get out of the
town."</p>

<p>"How are we going to get to Gardenville?" demanded
Pardo. "If we take the <i>Iris</i>&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"We won't."</p>

<p>"If we walk&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We won't do that, either. We'll take an automobile.
It may be, too, that our motor cycles will come in handy.
You go down to the bank, Pardo, signal the yacht, and
have Pierson bring the two machines ashore. While
you're about that, Bunce and I will visit the garage and
borrow a fast machine. You know these hills?"</p>

<p>"As well as I do my two hands."</p>

<p>"On your way to the <i>Iris</i> I'll give you something to
leave at the hotel for Motor Matt."</p>

<p>Grattan did some more scribbling on a blank sheet of
his notebook; then, tearing out the sheet, he wrapped it
around a small object and placed both in a little box with
a sliding cover.</p>

<p>"They may recognize me at the hotel," protested
Pardo.</p>

<p>"I don't think so. It will do me good to have you
leave this, anyhow. I don't want Motor Matt to think
that I was fooled very long by that bogus ruby. If we're
quick, Pardo, we're going to catch Tsan Ti before he
can leave Gardenville. And when we nab the mandarin
we secure the ruby."</p>

<p>Grattan was a master rogue, and not the least of his
shining abilities was his readiness in adjusting himself
to changing circumstances.</p>

<p>Fate, in the present instance, had conspired to place
him on the wrong track&mdash;but he was following the course
with supreme confidence.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">SHOCK NUMBER ONE.</p>


<p>When Motor Matt and Joe McGlory dropped off that
"local" passenger train at the Catskill station they had
just finished a series of strenuous experiences. These had
to do with the great ruby known as the Eye of Buddha.
A cunning <i>facsimile</i> of the gem had been sent by Tsan
Ti to Matt, by express, with a letter desiring him to take
care of the ruby until the mandarin should call for it.
This responsibility, entirely unsought by the king of the
motor boys, plunged him and his cowboy pard into a
whirl of adventures, and ended in their being decoyed
aboard the <i>Iris</i>. Here the ruby was taken from Matt
by force&mdash;Grattan, who secured it, not learning until
some time later that the object Matt had been caring for
was merely a base counterfeit of the original gem. And
Matt and McGlory did not find this out until they caught
the train at Fairview, when they discovered that Tsan Ti
and Sam Wing were aboard.</p>

<p>The twenty-mile ride from Fairview to Catskill with
the mandarin proved quite an eye opener for the motor
boys. They learned how Tsan Ti had deliberately set
Grattan on their track to recover the bogus ruby, while
he&mdash;Tsan Ti&mdash;made his escape with the real gem.</p>

<p>This part of the mandarin's talk failed to make much
of a "hit" with Matt and McGlory. The mandarin had
used them for his purposes in a particularly high-handed
manner, keeping them entirely in the dark regarding the
fact that the stone intrusted to Matt was a counterfeit.</p>

<p>Although the boys parted in a friendly way with the
mandarin on leaving the train at Catskill, yet they nevertheless
remembered their grievance and were heartily
glad to think that they were done for all time with Tsan
Ti and his ruby.</p>

<p>Very often it happens that when we think we are done
with a thing we have reckoned without taking account
of a perverse fate. This was the case with the motor
boys with reference to Tsan Ti and the Eye of Buddha.</p>

<p>While they were climbing the slope from the railroad
station to their hotel, glad of the prospect of securing a
little much-needed rest, only a few chance remarks by
McGlory prevented them from having an encounter with
Grattan, Pardo, and Bunce, who were lurking beside the
walk. And at that same moment the faithless Sam Wing
was engineering his stealthy theft in the darkened passenger
coach.</p>

<p>So stirring events were forming, all unheeded by the
boys.</p>

<p>Upon reaching the hotel they proceeded immediately to
the room which they occupied, hastily disrobed, and crept
into their respective beds. In less than five minutes the
room was resounding with McGlory's snores. Matt remained
awake long enough to review the events of the
day and to congratulate himself that he and his cowboy
pard were finally rid of the "hoodoo" gem and the
"hoodoo" Chinaman who had been looking for it. Then
the king of the motor boys himself fell asleep.</p>

<p>It was McGlory's voice that aroused Matt.</p>

<p>"Sufferin' thunderbolts!" Matt awoke with a start
and turned his eyes toward the other side of the room.
The cowboy was sitting up in bed. "Talk about your
shocking times, pard," he went on, "why, I've been
jumping from one shock into another ever since I hit
this mattress. Thought I was chased by a blind idol,
twenty feet high, and sometimes that idol looked like
Grattan, sometimes it was a dead ringer for Tsan Ti,
and sometimes it was its own wabble-jawed, horrible self.
Woosh! And listen"&mdash;McGlory's eyes grew wide and
he became very serious&mdash;"the idol that chased me had
<i>red hair</i>!"</p>

<p>"What difference does that make, Joe?" inquired Matt,
observing that the sun was high and forthwith tumbling
out of bed.</p>

<p>"What difference does it make!" gasped McGlory.
"Speak to me about that! Don't you know Matt, that
whenever you dream about a person with red hair,
trouble's on the pike and you've got up your little red
flag?"</p>

<p>"Oh, gammon!" grunted Matt. "Pile out and get into
your clothes, Joe. We're taking the eleven a. m. boat
for the big town, and we haven't any too much time
to make our 'twilight,' help ourselves to a late breakfast,
and amble down to the landing."</p>

<p>"Hooray!" cried McGlory, forgetting his dream in the
prospect called up by his chum's words. "We're going
to have the time of our lives in New York, pard! All I
hope is that nothing gets between us and that eleven
a. m. boat. Seems like we never make a start for down
the river but Johnny Hardluck comes along, jolts us
with an uppercut, and faces us the wrong way. Look
here, once."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"If you get a letter from Tsan Ti, promise me to say
'manana' and give it the cut direct."</p>

<p>"What chance is there of our receiving a letter from
the mandarin? He's on his way West with the Eye of
Buddha, and Grattan is on his way no one knows where
with a glass imitation. Both of them are satisfied, and
I guess you and I, Joe, haven't any cause for complaint.
The mandarin is too busy traveling to write any letters."</p>

<p>"Well," insisted McGlory, "give me your solemn promise
you won't pay any attention to a letter from the
mandarin if you receive one. If you're so plumb certain
he won't write, why not promise?"</p>

<p>"It's a go," laughed Matt, "if that will make you feel
any easier in your mind."</p>

<p>"It does, a heap. I'd rather have measles than another
attack of mandarinicutis, complicated with rubyitis,
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, splash!" interrupted Matt. "We've been well
paid for all the time we were ailing with those two
troubles. Give your hair a lick and a promise, and let's
go down to breakfast. They'll be ringing the last bell
on us if we wait much longer."</p>

<p>"Lead on, Macduff!" answered McGlory, throwing
himself around in the air and then striking a pose, with
one arm up, like Ajax defying the lightning. "Remember
Monte Cristo like that, pard?" he asked. "'The
world is mine!' That's how I feel. Us for New York,
with fifteen hundred of the mandarin's <i>dinero</i> in our
clothes! Oh, say, I'm a brass band and I've just got to
toot!"</p>

<p>The cowboy "tooted" all the way downstairs and into
the office; then, as they passed the desk on their way to
the dining room, the rejoicing died on the cowboy's lips.</p>

<p>"Just a minute, Motor Matt!" called the clerk, leaning
over the desk and motioning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>"Lightning's going to strike," muttered McGlory; "I
can see it coming."</p>

<p>He followed Matt to the desk. As they lined up there,
the clerk fished a small box out of the office safe.</p>

<p>"This was left here for you last night, Matt," went
on the clerk. "I was told to hand it to you this morning
by the night clerk when he went off duty."</p>

<p>The little box was placed on the counter. Matt and
McGlory stared at it.</p>

<p>That was not the first time they had seen that small
receptacle. With the counterfeit ruby inside, it had first
come into Matt's hands by express, direct from Tsan Ti;
then, by a somewhat devious course of events, it had
gone into the possession of Philo Grattan.</p>

<p>Why should Grattan have returned the box to Matt?
How <i>could</i> he have returned it when, as Matt and McGlory
believed, he was at that very moment hurrying to
get out of the country and escape the law?</p>

<p>"Shock number one," shuddered McGlory.</p>

<p>"Not much of a shock about this&mdash;so far," returned
Matt, picking up the box.</p>

<p>"Wait till you see what's inside."</p>

<p>"We'll open it in the dining room," and Matt turned
away.</p>

<p>"I'll bet a bowl of birds'-nest soup against a plate of
sharks' fins it's going to spoil your breakfast."</p>

<p>They went in and took their usual places at one of the
tables. All the other guests had breakfasted, and the
motor boys had the big dining room&mdash;with the exception
of two or three waiters&mdash;wholly to themselves.</p>

<p>"Open it quick," urged McGlory.</p>

<p>Matt sawed through the string with his knife, pulled
out the lid of the box, and dropped a gleaming red object
on the tablecloth.</p>

<p>"Sufferin' snakes!" exclaimed McGlory. "The Eye of
Buddha, or I'm a Piute! How in blazes did old Tsan
Ti get the thing back to us? When I saw that last it
was in a silk bag around the mandarin's neck."</p>

<p>"It can't be the Eye of Buddha, Joe," said Matt. "It
looks to me more like the bogus gem than the real one."</p>

<p>"How can you tell the difference?"</p>

<p>"From the fact that the real stone could not by any
possibility get into our hands again."</p>

<p>"Neither could the bogus gem&mdash;if it's where we think
it is."</p>

<p>"I guess here's something that will explain," and Matt
drew a piece of paper from the box.</p>

<p>"Who's it from?" queried McGlory, in a flutter.</p>

<p>"From Grattan," answered Matt grimly. "Listen,"
and he read:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'<span class="smcap">Motor Matt</span>: You don't know what a tight squeak
you and McGlory had to-night&mdash;not aboard the <i>Iris</i>, but
after you were put ashore. Pray accept the inclosed
piece of glass with my compliments. I don't think you
knew, any more than I did, that it was counterfeit. If
Tsan Ti gets into any more difficulties, you take my
advice and let him weather them alone.</p>

<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Grattan.</span>'"<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>"Shocked?" muttered McGlory. "Why, I feel as
though somebody had hit me with a live wire. So Grattan
found out the ruby was an imitation! And he found
out in time to send that back to you last night! Say,
that fellow's the king bee of all the crooks that ever
lived. Present the jewel to one of these darky waiters,
and let's you and I get busy with the ham and eggs.
I'm glad we're for New York by the eleven-o'clock
boat, and that the mandarin isn't worrying us any
more."</p>

<p>The cowboy threw the box under the table, and would
have reached for the gleaming bit of glass had not Matt
grabbed it first and dropped it into his pocket.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">SHOCKS TWO AND THREE.</p>


<p>The motor boys were very much in the dark concerning
Philo Grattan's movements and intentions.</p>

<p>"He was right," observed Matt, referring to Grattan's
note, "when he said I was in the dark as much as he was
concerning that piece of glass. He wasn't fooled very
long."</p>

<p>"There's good advice in that note," said McGlory, who
was beginning to have apprehensions that he and Matt
were not yet done with the Eye of Buddha. "I mean
where he says that if the mandarin gets into any more
difficulties we'll be wise to let him get out of them alone
the best way he can."</p>

<p>"That's more than a piece of advice, Joe. If I catch
the true meaning, it's a threat."</p>

<p>McGlory at once saw a light in the general gloom.</p>

<p>"Then, if it's a threat, pard, Grattan must be ready to
make another try for the Eye of Buddha!"</p>

<p>"That's the way it strikes me."</p>

<p>"But what can Grattan do? Tsan Ti ought to be
whooping it up pretty well to the west by now. He's got
a good long start of Grattan in the run to 'Frisco."</p>

<p>"What Grattan can do," said Matt reflectively, "is as
hard to understand as what he has already done. We
know he has discovered that this red jewel is a counterfeit,
we know he sent some one here to return the piece
of crimson glass to me, and it's a fair inference that he's
going to make another attempt to recover the real ruby.
How he has managed to do all this, however, or what he
can possibly accomplish in overhauling Tsan Ti, is far
and away beyond me."</p>

<p>"We're out of it, anyhow," remarked McGlory, with
an airy confidence he was far from feeling. "You've
promised not to pay any attention to any four-eleven
alarms you receive from the mandarin, and I'd feel tolerably
comfortable over the outlook if&mdash;if&mdash;&mdash;" He paused.</p>

<p>"If what?" queried Matt.</p>

<p>"Why, if I hadn't seen that red-headed idol chasing
me in my sleep. I had two good looks at it. One look
means trouble, two looks mean double trouble. Call me
a Piegan if I ever knew it to fail."</p>

<p>Matt laughed.</p>

<p>"Never trouble trouble," he admonished, "till trouble
troubles you."</p>

<p>"Fine!" exclaimed McGlory; "but it's like a good
many of these keen old saws&mdash;hard to live up to. I'll
bet the inventor of that little spiel died of worry in
some poorhouse. I'm always on my toes, shading my
eyes with my hat brim and looking for miles along the
trail of life to see if I can't pick up a little hard luck
heading my way. Can't wait till I come company front
with it. Well, maybe it's all right. Life would be sort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
of tame if something didn't happen now and then to
make us ginger up. But we're for New York at eleven
o'clock, no matter what happens!"</p>

<p>A few minutes later they finished their breakfast and
went out into the office. As Matt pushed up to the
desk to ask the amount of his hotel bill, and settle for
it, the clerk shoved a yellow envelope at him.</p>

<p>"Telegram, Matt. Just got here."</p>

<p>"Shock two," groaned McGlory, grabbing at the edge
of the desk. "<i>Now</i> what? Oh, tell me!"</p>

<p>Matt tore open the envelope, read the message, stared
at it, whistled, then read it again.</p>

<p>"Somebody want us to run an air ship or go to sea
in a submarine?" palpitated McGlory. "Sufferin' tenterhooks,
pard! Stop your staring and whistling, and
hand it to me right off the bat."</p>

<p>Matt caught McGlory's arm and conducted him to a
corner where there were a couple of easy-chairs.</p>

<p>"It's from the mandarin," he announced.</p>

<p>"Sufferin' chinks!" breathed the cowboy. "Didn't I
tell you? Say, <i>didn't</i> I? What's hit him now?"</p>

<p>"I'll read you the message, Joe."</p>

<p>"Go ahead. All I want you to do, pard, is just to
remember what you promised me."</p>

<p>"'Esteemed friend,'" read Matt, "'and highly treasured
assistant in time of storm&mdash;&mdash;'"</p>

<p>"Speak to me about that!" grunted the disgusted McGlory.
"His word box is full of beadwork."</p>

<p>"'Again I call from the bottomless pit of distress,'"
continued Matt, "'and from this place named Gardenville
announce the duplicity of Sam Wing, who suddenly
absented himself from the train with my supply
of cash and the Eye of Buddha. Having no money, I
have requested of the honorable telegraph company to
receive pay from you. If&mdash;&mdash;'"</p>

<p>"He's lost the ruby!" gasped McGlory, "and Sam
Wing is the guilty man! Oh, Moses, what a throwdown!
Why, I had a notion Sam Wing thought the
sun rose and set in Tsan Ti. And Sam Wing lifted
the ruby and the mandarin's funds and hot-footed it
for parts unknown! Well, <i>well</i>!"</p>

<p>"'If,'" continued Matt, continuing the reading, "'I
cannot recover the priceless gem, then nothing is left for
me but the yellow cord. Hasten, noble youth, and aid
in catching the miserable Sam Wing.' That's all, Joe,"
finished Matt, with a frown.</p>

<p>"Then drop it in the waste basket and let's settle our
bill and start for the landing. It's a quarter to eleven.
While you're paying up I'll go to the room after our
grips."</p>

<p>The cowboy started impatiently to his feet. Matt continued
to sit in his chair, frowning and peering into
vacancy.</p>

<p>"Mosey!" urged Joe.</p>

<p>"It seems too bad to turn Tsan Ti down in such cold-blooded
fashion," said Matt.</p>

<p>"There you go! That's you! Say, pard, the mandarin
thinks he's got a mortgage on you. What's the
good of helping a chink who's so locoed he totes a fifty-thousand-dollar
ruby around with him rather than hand
it over to the express company for transportation? Take
it from me, you can keep helping Tsan Ti for the next
hundred years, and he'll never get out of the country
till he separates himself from the Eye of Buddha and
let some one else take the risk of getting it to Canton.
Are you going?"</p>

<p>"The poor old duffer," continued Matt, "is always
right up in the air when anything goes wrong with him.
We know what the safe return of that ruby to the Honam
joss house means to him, Joe. The ruler of China has
sent him a yellow cord&mdash;a royal invitation for him to
strangle himself if the ruby is not found and returned
to the forehead of the idol."</p>

<p>"Look here," snapped McGlory, "time's getting scarce.
Are you going down the river with me, pard, or have I
got to go alone?"</p>

<p>Before Matt could answer, a well-dressed man hurried
into the lobby from the street and rushed for the
desk as though he had something on his mind.</p>

<p>"That's Martin," said Matt, looking at the man.</p>

<p>Martin was proprietor of the local garage and had
been of considerable assistance to the motor boys during
the first days of their stay in Catskill. It was Martin
who owned the two motor cycles which had been stolen
from Matt and McGlory by Bunce and a pal. The boys
had had to put up three hundred dollars to settle for
that escapade, but Tsan Ti had made the amount good.</p>

<p>Martin talked excitedly with the hotel clerk for a moment,
and the clerk leaned over the desk and pointed
toward the corner where the motor boys had seated
themselves. Martin, a look of satisfaction crossing his
troubled face, bore down on the corner.</p>

<p>"Look out for shock number three," growled McGlory.
"Sufferin' hoodoos! We've taken root here in
Catskill, and I'll bet we won't be able to pull out for the
rest of our natural lives."</p>

<p>The cowboy, apparently discouraged with the outlook,
dropped down into his chair and leaned back in weary
resignation.</p>

<p>"Matt!" exclaimed Martin, "you're just the fellow I
want to find."</p>

<p>"What's wrong, Mr. Martin?" inquired Matt.</p>

<p>"A three-thousand-dollar car was stolen out of my
garage last night. The night man was attacked, knocked
over the head, and then bound hand and foot. It was a
most brazen and dastardly piece of work."</p>

<p>"Too bad," spoke up McGlory, "but things like that
will happen occasionally. Think of Matt and me getting
done out of those two motor cycles of yours."</p>

<p>"But I'll have to put up ten times what you fellows
did for the motor cycles&mdash;that is, if we can't get the car
back."</p>

<p>"<i>We!</i>" boomed McGlory, starting forward in his chair.
"If <i>we</i> can't get the car back! Are Motor Matt and
Pard McGlory mixed up in that 'we'?"</p>

<p>"Well, I thought when you knew the circumstances
that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't hem, and haw, and sidestep," cut in McGlory
keenly. "You're in trouble, and whenever anybody in
the whole country stumbles against something that's gone
crosswise, then it's 'Hurrah, boys,' and send for Motor
Matt. I wish I had words to tell you how inexpressibly
weary all this makes me. Didn't you ever stop to think,
Martin, that, off and on, the motor boys might have
troubles of their own?"</p>

<p>"But listen. You haven't heard the facts."</p>

<p>"What are the facts, Martin?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>"Why, the night man recognized one of the scoundrels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
who struck him down. The rascal was dressed in sailor
clothes and had a green patch over one eye."</p>

<p>"Bunce!" exclaimed Matt, starting up.</p>

<p>"That's it," cried Martin, glad of the impression he
was making. "I knew you and McGlory had been mixed
up with that sailor, and I naturally thought you'd be
glad of a chance to help nab him."</p>

<p>"About what time was the car stolen?" asked Matt,
quieting McGlory with a quick look.</p>

<p>"About half-past two," answered Martin. "I've got
a car ready to chase the scoundrels. Have you any
notion which way that car ought to go?"</p>

<p>"You're a trifle late taking up the pursuit," remarked
Matt. "Here it is nearly eleven, and the automobile
was stolen at half-past two&mdash;more than eight hours
ago."</p>

<p>"I was up at Cairo," explained Martin, "and didn't
get back till ten o'clock this morning."</p>

<p>"I've something of a clue," said Matt, "but it may be
too late to follow it."</p>

<p>"Where does the clue lead?"</p>

<p>"To Gardenville."</p>

<p>"Then we'll make a fast run to Gardenville. Will
you go along?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Matt. "Come on, Joe."</p>

<p>And McGlory dutifully went. As he, and Matt, and
Martin passed out of the hotel, the down-river boat from
Albany whistled for Catskill Landing. The cowboy
looked at it.</p>

<p>"We'll never get to New York," he murmured; "not
in a thousand years. We're out for two different kinds
of trouble, and we'll be into both of 'em up to our eyes
before we're many hours older."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">A HOT STARTER.</p>


<p>Motor Matt disliked any further entanglements with
Tsan Ti and the fateful ruby fully as much as did his
cowboy pard, and he was greatly perturbed over the
unexpected developments which had again drawn him
and McGlory into the plots and counterplots hovering
around the valuable gem. But it was impossible for
the king of the motor boys to turn his back upon an
appeal from any one in distress when it was in his
power to be of help. Nevertheless, Matt might have
cut loose from the mandarin, for he did not like his
Oriental methods, but his temper was stirred by that
half-veiled threat in the note from Grattan.</p>

<p>Matt and Grattan had been at swords' points ever
since the motor boys had been in the Catskills. It was
largely a battle of wits, with now and then a little violence
thrown in for good measure, and up to that moment
neither Matt nor Grattan had scored decisively.</p>

<p>Through Matt's intrepid work, Tsan Ti had recovered
the stolen ruby, but, as in the case where he had lost
the counterfeit gem, Matt's success had been merely a
fortunate blunder. On the other side of the account,
Grattan could be charged with a theft of the two motor
cycles and with sundry other sharp practices which had
gone too much "against the grain" for Matt to overlook.
The daring theft of the automobile from the garage
pointed the way not only for Matt to help Martin
recover the machine, but perhaps, also, to recover the
motor cycles, to worst Grattan, and to be of some assistance
to Tsan Ti.</p>

<p>On the way to the garage with Martin, Matt explained
these matters to McGlory.</p>

<p>With the whistle of the New York boat still sounding
in his ears, the cowboy listened to his chum, at first,
with intense disapproval; but, at the back of McGlory's
nature, there was as intense a dislike for being worsted
by such a crook as Grattan as there was at the back
of Matt's.</p>

<p>Cleverly the king of the motor boys harped on this
chord, and aroused in his chum a wild desire to do something
that would curb, finally and effectually, the audacious
lawlessness of Philo Grattan. To such an extent
did Matt influence McGlory that the latter began
to wonder how he could ever have thought of leaving
the Catskills while Grattan was at large.</p>

<p>"Sufferin' justice!" exclaimed the cowboy. "Grattan
is trying to bluff us out of helping the mandarin. That's
as plain as the pay streak in a bonanza mine. He must
have been with Bunce when the bubble was lifted, and
if we chase the chug cart we can hand the boss tinhorn
a black eye by getting back the machine and landing
the thieves in the skookum house. Say, that would be
nuts for me! The mandarin and his idol's eye can go
hang&mdash;it's Grattan we're after this trip."</p>

<p>Matt left his chum with that impression, well knowing
that if Grattan could be captured, the affairs of the
mandarin would adjust themselves satisfactorily.</p>

<p>The night man at the garage, his head bandaged, was
lingering in the big room, watching one of the day
men give a final wipe to the lamps of a six-cylinder flyer
that was to take the trail after Grattan. The night man's
face flushed joyfully when he saw Matt and McGlory.</p>

<p>"Good!" he exclaimed. "I guess there'll be something
doing in these parts, now that Motor Matt is going to
help in the chase."</p>

<p>"You're the man who was on duty when the automobile
was stolen?" inquired Matt.</p>

<p>"Don't I look the part?"</p>

<p>"Martin says you identified one of the men as the old
sailor who wears a green patch over one of his eyes."</p>

<p>"Seen him as plain as I do you, this minute."</p>

<p>"What did the other thief look like?"</p>

<p>"Didn't have a chance to tell, the attack was that
sudden an' unexpected."</p>

<p>"You are sure there were no more than two of the
thieves?"</p>

<p>"I could take my solemn Alfred on that."</p>

<p>"All aboard!" called Martin, from the car. "I'm going
to let you do the driving, Matt. You can forget
more about automobiles than I ever knew."</p>

<p>Matt stepped to the side of the car and drew on a pair
of gauntlets that lay in the driver's seat; then he climbed
to his place, McGlory got in behind, and the car was
backed around and glided out through the wide door of
the garage.</p>

<p>With Martin indicating the way, the machine slipped
rapidly out of Catskill and darted off on the Gardenville
road.</p>

<p>"What sort of clue is taking us to Gardenville?" asked
Martin, as they weaved in and out among the tree-covered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
hills, catching occasional glimpses of the sparkling
waters of the Hudson.</p>

<p>Matt informed Martin briefly of Tsan Ti's predicament
and of Grattan's persistent attempts to get hold of
the ruby.</p>

<p>"You think Grattan has gone to Gardenville to intercept
Tsan Ti?" asked Martin.</p>

<p>"It would be like Grattan," Matt answered, "to hire
Sam Wing to steal the ruby from the mandarin. I don't
know that Grattan has done that, but it would be like
him. If he did, then he would travel toward Gardenville
to pick up Sam Wing."</p>

<p>"This looks too much like guesswork," muttered Martin,
"and not very bright guesswork, either."</p>

<p>"I think the same way, Martin; but it's the only clue
we have. Grattan and Bunce certainly had an object in
view when they stole the motor car. The theft, happening
at the time it did, rather inclines me to think that
Grattan is beginning a swift campaign to recover the
Eye of Buddha."</p>

<p>"Since half-past two he has had oceans of time to
reach Gardenville and pick up Sam Wing and the ruby&mdash;if
that was his game."</p>

<p>"Exactly," returned Matt. "I was telling you the
same thing back at the hotel. What sort of a car was it
that was stolen?"</p>

<p>"It was a blue car, six cylinder, and had a tonneau and
top. It belonged to a man from New York. He's been
telegraphing and telephoning all through the mountains.
If the thieves didn't get away last night, they'll have a
hard time doing it to-day."</p>

<p>Matt was watching the road. It was a popular highway
for motor-car owners, and the surface bore evidence
of the passage of many pneumatic tires. Half a dozen
cars passed them, going the other way, and inquiries
were made as to the blue car. The stolen automobile
had not been seen or heard of. At least two of the passing
drivers had come from Gardenville, and their failure
to have seen anything of the stolen machine promised
ill for the success of the pursuers when they should
reach their destination.</p>

<p>"I guess I'm up against it, all right," growled Martin.
"This Grattan is a clever scoundrel, and he'll know what
to do to keep from getting captured."</p>

<p>"What's that place ahead there?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>What he saw was a spot where the road curved a
little to one side in a valley between two hills. There
were two or three hitching posts planted beside the road,
and from one of the posts swung a tin bucket.</p>

<p>"That's a spring," said Martin, "and it furnishes ice-cold
water in the very hottest part of the summer. People
stop there to water their horses&mdash;and to get a drink
themselves if they're thirsty."</p>

<p>"Let's stop, pard," called McGlory, from the tonneau.
"I'm dryer than a sand pile and my throat's full of dust."</p>

<p>"We're only three miles from Gardenville," spoke up
Martin, his words significant of the fact that there would
be plenty of drinking water to be had in the town without
delaying the journey at the spring.</p>

<p>"We'll only be a minute," said Matt, swerving to the
side of the road and bringing the car to a halt.</p>

<p>All three jumped out, and Martin led the way to a
small pool, shaded by overhanging trees. From beyond
the pool came a tinkle of falling water.</p>

<p>"Horses are watered from this basin," remarked Martin.
"The water falls from the rocks, farther on, and
we'll find a cup there."</p>

<p>A well-worn path followed the rill that supplied the
pool, and the three continued onward along the path in
single file. Half a dozen yards brought them to the
rocky side hill where the water welled from a crack in
the granite and fell in a miniature cataract to a bowl-shaped
depression at the foot of the wall.</p>

<p>A man was standing beside the spring when Martin,
Matt, and McGlory emerged from the tangle of brush
and vines. The man was just lifting himself erect after
filling a tin cup that was chained to the rocks. Startled
into inaction, the man stood staring at the three newcomers,
the filled cup in his hand.</p>

<p>The surprise, it may be observed, was mutual.</p>

<p>The man by the spring was a Chinaman&mdash;a lean,
hatchet-faced individual whose blouse and baggy trousers
gave evidence of rough work in the undergrowth.</p>

<p>"Sam Wing!" yelled McGlory.</p>

<p>Yes, it was the treacherous Celestial, there was not
the slightest doubt about that.</p>

<p>Simultaneously with his shout, McGlory leaped forward,
closely followed by Matt. Sam Wing awoke to
his peril not a second too soon. Casting the cup of water
full in the cowboy's face, the Chinaman gave vent to a
defiant yell, whirled, and vanished among the trees.</p>

<p>McGlory sputtered wrathfully as he shook the water
out of his eyes. Matt bounded on in frantic pursuit of
the fugitive.</p>

<p>"Come back!" cried Martin, thinking of nothing but
the stolen car. "What's the use of chasing the chink?"</p>

<p>"You freeze to the automobile, Martin," the cowboy
paused to answer. "Matt and I will put the kibosh on
this yellow grafter and then we'll rejoin you. We'll not
be gone long."</p>

<p>The words faded in a rattle and crash of violently
disturbed bushes, and McGlory had vanished along his
chum's trail.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">M'GLORY IS LOST&mdash;AND FOUND.</p>


<p>This unexpected encounter with Sam Wing was certainly
a "hot starter" in the matter of the stolen ruby,
although of apparently small consequence in the matter
of the stolen car. But Motor Matt was not particular
as to which end of the double thread fortune wafted his
way. He followed Sam Wing just as zealously as he
would have followed Philo Grattan, had it been the
white thief instead of the yellow who had fled from the
spring.</p>

<p>The cold spring water had run down the cowboy's
face, under his collar, and had glued his shirt to his
wet skin.</p>

<p>"Speak to me about that!" he breathed angrily, as he
labored on. "If the rat-eater hadn't slammed that water
into my face, I'd have had him by his yellow throat in a
brace of shakes! Wow, but it's cold! I feel as though
I was hugging an iceberg. Where's Matt?"</p>

<p>McGlory had not seen his chum since he had plunged
into the bushes, but had followed blindly in a course he
believed to be the right one, trying only to see how
much ground he could cover.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, realizing suddenly that he might be on the
wrong track, the cowboy halted, peered around him, and
listened intently. The timber was thick and the bushes
dense on every side. There were no sounds in any
direction even remotely suggesting the Chinaman's flight
and Matt's pursuit.</p>

<p>"I'm off my bearings and no mistake," reflected the
cowboy, searching the ground in vain for some signs of
the course taken by Sam Wing and Matt. "Matt will
have a time overhauling the chink in this chaparral, and
the two of us are needed. But which way am I to go?"</p>

<p>McGlory had been hurrying along the side hill that
edged the valley and the road. He swept his eyes across
the narrow valley, and then up the slope toward the top
of the hill.</p>

<p>"It's a cinch," he ruminated, "that Sam Wing wouldn't
go near the trail, but would do his level best to get as
far away from it as he could. That means, if I'm any
guesser, that he climbed the hill and tried to lose himself
beyond. Me for the other side," and the cowboy
began pawing and scrambling up the steep slope.</p>

<p>Ten minutes of hard work brought him to the crest,
and here again he halted to peer anxiously around and to
listen. He could neither hear nor see anything that gave
him a line on Matt and the Chinaman.</p>

<p>"Whoop-ya!" he yelled at the top of his lungs. "Matt!
Where are you, pard?"</p>

<p>A jaybird mocked him from somewhere in the timber,
and a frightened hawk took wing and soared skyward.</p>

<p>"Blamed if this ain't real excitin'!" growled the cowboy.
"I'm going to do something to help lay that yellow
tinhorn by the heels, though, and you can paste that in
your hat. If Matt came over the hill, then it stands to
reason he went down on this other side. I'll keep on, by
guess and by gosh, and maybe something will happen."</p>

<p>McGlory kept on for half an hour, floundering through
the bushes, making splendid time in his slide to the foot
of the hill, and from there striking out on an erratic
course that carried him toward all points of the compass.
He climbed rocky hills and descended them, he
followed ravines, and he sprinted across narrow levels,
yelling for Matt from time to time, but receiving no
answer. Then he discovered that something had happened&mdash;and
that he was lost.</p>

<p>Trying to locate himself by the position of the sun, he
endeavored to return to the road. Instead of calling for
Matt, he now began whooping it up for Martin. The
sun appeared to be in the wrong place, and the road
and the spring had vanished. The farther McGlory went,
the more confused and bewildered he became. At last
he dropped down on a bowlder and panted out his chagrin
and disgust.</p>

<p>"Lost! Me, Joseph Easy Mark McGlory, Arizona
puncher and boss trailer of the deserts and the foothills!
Lost, plumb tangled up in my bearings, clean gone
off the jump&mdash;and in this two-by-twice range of toy
mountains where Rip Van Winkle snoozed for twenty
years. I wonder if Rip was as tired as I am when he
laid down to snatch his forty winks. Sufferin' tenderfoot!
I've walked far enough to carry me plumb to Albany,
if it had all been in a straight line. Matt!" and
again he lifted his voice. "Martin!"</p>

<p>The lusty yell echoed and reverberated through the surrounding
woods, but brought no answer.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, the cowboy was seized from behind
by a pair of stout arms, pulled backward off the bowlder,
and flattened out on the ground by a heavy knee on his
chest.</p>

<p>It had all happened so quickly that McGlory was
dazed. He was a moment or two in recovering his wits
and in recognizing the sinister face and mocking eyes
that bent down over him.</p>

<p>"Grattan!" he gasped.</p>

<p>"Ay, messmate," gibed a voice from near at hand;
"Grattan and Bunce. Don't forget Bunce."</p>

<p>The cowboy turned his head and saw the sailor. The
green patch decorated one of the sailor's eyes, but the
other eye taunted the luckless prisoner with an exultant
gleam.</p>

<p>McGlory struggled desperately under Grattan's hands.</p>

<p>"Stop it!" ordered Grattan.</p>

<p>As McGlory had made no headway with his frantic
struggles, he decided to obey the command.</p>

<p>"What are you doing out here in the woods?" inquired
Grattan.</p>

<p>"Ease up on that throat a little," wheezed the cowboy.
"Want to take the breath all out of me?" The thief's
fingers relaxed slightly. "I left the road a spell ago,"
proceeded McGlory, "and went wide of my bearings
somewhere&mdash;I don't know just where."</p>

<p>"Lost, eh?" laughed Grattan. "Well, my lad, you've
been found."</p>

<p>"How did you happen to find me?"</p>

<p>"How?" jeered Bunce. "You was makin' more noise
than a foghorn. The way you was askin' Motor Matt
for help, it's a wonder they didn't hear you in Catskill."</p>

<p>"Tie his hands with something, Bunce," said Grattan.</p>

<p>Bunce looked taken aback for a space, then whipped
his knife laniard from about his neck, removed the knife,
doubled the cord, and contrived a lashing that was
strong enough to answer the purpose.</p>

<p>Grattan heaved the cowboy over upon his face and
pulled his wrists behind him. In less than a minute the
cord was in place, and the prisoner was freed of Grattan's
gripping hands and allowed to sit up, his back
against the bowlder.</p>

<p>"This meeting," grinned Grattan, "was entirely unexpected,
and a pleasant surprise."</p>

<p>"A pleasant surprise for you, I reckon," grunted McGlory.
"What did you jump onto me for like this?
What good is it going to do you?"</p>

<p>"What benefit I am to derive from this encounter,"
replied Grattan, "remains to be seen. Tell me, my lad,
are you and Motor Matt looking for Tsan Ti?"</p>

<p>An angry denial was on the cowboy's lips, but he
thought better of the words before they were spoken.</p>

<p>"Never you mind who we're looking for, Grattan,"
said he.</p>

<p>"It's for Tsan Ti, I am sure," went on Grattan. "He's
somewhere in this section, for he left Gardenville on
foot, early this morning, preceded by his man, Sam
Wing. I don't know exactly what's up, but I'm rather
inclined to think that the mandarin is afraid of me, and
is trying to get back to Catskill and place himself under
the wing of his estimable protector, Motor Matt. You
and Matt heard he was coming and advanced to meet
him. The same man who told me the fat Chinaman was
in the hills must have given you boys the same information."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>"Who was the <i>hombre</i>, Grattan?" queried McGlory,
secretly delighted to think Grattan's speculations were
so wide of the mark.</p>

<p>"A man in a white runabout with a red torpedo beard."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't know a red torpedo beard from a Piute's
scalplock, but I do recollect a shuffer in a white car."</p>

<p>This white runabout was one of the cars Matt, Martin,
and McGlory had passed on the road, and the driver
was one of those of whom they had made inquiries.
The inquiries, of course, had been all about the stolen
automobile and not about the fat Chinaman. If Grattan
had been in the stolen car when asking the man in
the white runabout for news of Tsan Ti, then why
hadn't the runabout driver remembered the blue car
and told Matt something about it?</p>

<p>"Where were you," went on the cowboy, "when you
hailed the man in the white car?"</p>

<p>"On foot, by the spring," answered Grattan genially.</p>

<p>He was an educated man and usually good-natured&mdash;sometimes
under the most adverse circumstances. That
was his way, perhaps on the principle that an easy manner
is best calculated to disarm suspicion.</p>

<p>"Where was the car you and Bunce stole from the
Catskill garage?" asked the cowboy.</p>

<p>"We tucked it away in a pocket of the hills that my
friend Pardo knew about," explained Grattan, tacitly admitting
the theft and, in his customary fashion, not hesitating
to go elaborately into details. "We failed to finish
the work that took us to Gardenville last night.
When we learned at the railroad station in that town
that the fat Chinaman had started south on foot, about
break of day, following another of his countrymen, we
rushed the car back into an obscure place. It is not
advisable, you understand, to make that car too prominent.
We shall have to use it by night. Bunce and I
rode to the spring on our motor cycles for the purpose
of watching the road. The white runabout came along,
and the driver told us, he had passed Tsan Ti, walking
this way. We waited for him to pass the spring, but
he did not. Thinking he had taken to the rough country,
Bunce and I returned our wheels to the place where
we have pitched temporary camp and began prowling
around in the hope of finding the mandarin. Then,
quite unexpectedly, I assure you, we heard you calling.
We came to this place, guided by the sound of your
voice. You know the rest, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Grattan bit off his words abruptly. From a distance
came a hail, so far off as to be almost indistinguishable.</p>

<p>"Motor Matt!" exclaimed Grattan, with a laugh.
"He's looking for you, McGlory. If this keeps up, we're
going to have quite a reunion. Put a hand over his lips,
Bunce," he added to the sailor.</p>

<p>McGlory tried to give a desperate yell before the hand
closed over his mouth, but he was not quick enough.
Grattan, leaning against the bowlder, threw back his
head and answered the distant call.</p>

<p>The voice in the woods drew closer and closer.</p>

<p>"Call again, excellent one!" came the weary voice
from the scrub. "I heard you shouting some time ago,
and you were calling the name of an esteemed friend
for whom I am looking. Speak loudly to me, so that I
may come where you are."</p>

<p>The three by the bowlder were astounded.</p>

<p>"Tsan Ti," muttered Grattan, "or I don't know the
voice. Luck, Bunce! Whoever thought this could happen?
The mandarin heard McGlory calling for Motor
Matt&mdash;and now the mandarin is looking for McGlory
and is going to find <i>us</i>." A chuckle came with the words.
"Lie low, Bunce, and watch McGlory. Leave the trapping
of Tsan Ti to me."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">"POCKETED."</p>


<p>For the cowboy pleasant fancies were cropping out of
this surprising turn of events. He reflected that Grattan
did not know Sam Wing had stolen the ruby from Tsan
Ti. By entrapping Tsan Ti, Grattan was undoubtedly
counting upon getting hold of the Eye of Buddha.</p>

<p>If Bunce had known how little love McGlory had for
the mandarin, he would not have been at so much pains
to keep a hand over his lips. Just at that moment nothing
could have induced the cowboy to shout a warning to
the approaching Chinaman.</p>

<p>Kneeling behind the bowlder, Grattan lifted his voice
for Tsan Ti's benefit. Presently the mandarin was decoyed
around the side of the bowlder, and his capture
expeditiously effected.</p>

<p>He was a badly demoralized Chinaman. His usually
immaculate person had been eclipsed by recent hardships,
and he was tattered and torn and liberally sprinkled with
dust. His flabby cheeks were covered with red splotches
where thorny undergrowth had left its mark. He was so
fagged, too, that he could hardly stand. At the merest
touch from Grattan he tumbled over. A most melancholy
spectacle he presented as he sat on the ground and
stared at Grattan with jaws agape.</p>

<p>"Oh, friend of my friend," wheezed Tsan Ti, passing
his gaze to McGlory, "was it you who shouted?"</p>

<p>"First off it was," answered McGlory; "after that,
Grattan took it up."</p>

<p>"And you are a prisoner?"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't be here if I wasn't."</p>

<p>"I'm the man for you to talk to, Tsan Ti," put in Grattan
grimly. "It's me you're to reckon with."</p>

<p>"Evil individual," answered the mandarin, "my capture
will not help you in your rascally purposes. Is not my
present distress sufficient, without any of your unwelcome
attentions? Behold my plight! What more can
you do to make me miserable?"</p>

<p>"I can take the ruby away from you, for one thing."</p>

<p>A mirthless smile crossed the mandarin's fat face. A
chuckle escaped McGlory.</p>

<p>Grattan stared hard at the Chinaman, and then flashed
a quick glance at the cowboy.</p>

<p>"What are you thinking of, McGlory?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"I'm thinking that you're fooled again, Grattan," answered
McGlory. "You know so much that I wonder
you haven't heard that the mandarin has lost the ruby."</p>

<p>"Lost it?" A look of consternation crossed Grattan's
face. "I'll never believe that," he went on. "Tsan Ti
knows where the Eye of Buddha is, and there are ways
to make him tell me."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay," flared Bunce, with a fierce look, "we'll make
him tell if we have to lash him to a tree and flog the
truth out o' him."</p>

<p>"Wretches," said the mandarin, "no matter what your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
hard thoughts may counsel, or your wicked hands contrive,
you cannot make me tell what I do not know."</p>

<p>Grattan would not trust Bunce to search the mandarin,
but proceeded about the work himself. Two chopsticks,
a silver cigarette box, an ivory case with matches, a
bone-handled back scratcher, a handkerchief, a fan, and
a yellow cord some three feet long were the results of
the search.</p>

<p>There was no ruby. Grattan prodded a knife blade
into Tsan Ti's thick queue in his search for the gem,
and even ripped out the lining of his sandals, but uselessly.</p>

<p>"You know where the ruby is," scowled Grattan,
giving way to more wrath than McGlory had ever seen
him show before; "and, by Heaven, I'll make you tell
before I'm done with you."</p>

<p>Tossing the yellow cord to Bunce, Grattan drew back
and ordered the sailor to secure the mandarin's hands
in the same way he had lashed the cowboy's.</p>

<p>Tsan Ti seemed to accept the situation philosophically.
But that he was in desperate straits and hopeless was
evidenced by his remark when Bunce was done with the
tying:</p>

<p>"Despicable person, I had rather you put the yellow
cord about my throat than around my wrists."</p>

<p>"You'll get it around the throat when we get back to
the pocket," said Grattan brutally. "Take charge of
McGlory, Bunce," he added, "and come with me."</p>

<p>Tsan Ti was ordered to his feet. Thereupon, Grattan
seized his arm and pulled him along through the
woods.</p>

<p>McGlory would have given something handsome if he
could have had the use of his hands for about a minute.
Bunce would have been an easy problem for him to solve
if he had not been hampered by the knife laniard. As
it was, however, the cowboy was forced to get to his
feet and, with the sailor as guard, follow after Grattan
and Tsan Ti.</p>

<p>Captors and captives traveled for nearly a mile through
uneven country, thick with timber, then descended into
a ravine, followed it a little way beyond a point where
it was crossed by a wagon road, and came to a niche
in the gully wall.</p>

<p>Perhaps the term "cavern" would better describe the
place where Grattan, Pardo, and Bunce had pitched their
temporary camp. The hole was an ancient washout, its
face covered with a screen of brush and creepers.</p>

<p>In front of the niche, standing in a place where it had
been backed from the road on the "reverse," was the blue
automobile. Leaning against the automobile were the
two motor cycles; and from the tonneau of the car, as
Grattan and Bunce approached with their prisoners, arose
the form of Pardo.</p>

<p>"Well, well!" exclaimed Pardo, thrusting his head out
from under the top. "If we haven't got visitors! Where
did you pick up the mandarin, Grattan?"</p>

<p>"Between here and the Gardenville road," answered
Grattan. "It was easy work. Both the chink and the
cowboy were kind enough to yell and tell us where they
were."</p>

<p>Pardo, understanding little of what had really occurred,
opened his eyes wide.</p>

<p>"Tell me more about it," said he.</p>

<p>"After I get the prisoners in the pocket. Bunce, bring
a rope. Hold McGlory, Pardo, while he's doing it."</p>

<p>Pardo jumped down from the automobile and caught
the cowboy's arm.</p>

<p>"I guess you're a heap easier to deal with than your
friend, Motor Matt," was his comment.</p>

<p>"No guess about it," said McGlory, "it's a cinch. But
I'm not fretting any."</p>

<p>The cowboy's eyes were on the stolen car. What a
pleasure it would have been to snatch that automobile
out of Grattan's clutches, leaving him and his rascally
companions stranded in the hills! But that was a dream&mdash;and
McGlory had already had too many dreams for
his peace of mind.</p>

<p>Tsan Ti was shoved by Grattan through the bushes,
under the trailing vines and into the washout. Pardo
dragged McGlory through, close on their heels.</p>

<p>"Sit down, both of you," ordered Grattan, when the
prisoners were in the gloomy confines of the niche.</p>

<p>Tsan Ti and McGlory lowered themselves to the bare
earthen floor. Bunce came with the rope, and it was
coiled around the cowboy's ankles, and then around the
mandarin's.</p>

<p>"I've taken you in, McGlory," observed Grattan, to
the cowboy, "for the purpose of finding out what Motor
Matt is doing; and I've captured the mandarin with the
idea of getting the ruby. I'm a man who hews steadily
to the line, once he marks it out. I'll have my way with
both of you before I am done. Mark that. You can't
get away from here. Even if you were not bound hand
and foot, you'd have to pass the automobile in order to
reach the road&mdash;and Pardo, Bunce, and I will be in the
automobile. We're all heeled, which is a point you will
do well to remember."</p>

<p>Having eased his mind in this manner, Grattan went
out of the niche, Bunce and Pardo following him. They
could be heard climbing into the automobile, and then
their low voices came in a mumble to the ears of the
prisoners.</p>

<p>"Fated friend," gulped the mandarin, "the ten thousand
demons of misfortune are working sad havoc with
Tsan Ti."</p>

<p>"Buck up!" returned McGlory. "We're pocketed, all
right, but matters might be worse."</p>

<p>"What cheering thoughts can I possibly have?"
mourned the mandarin. "The Eye of Buddha has escaped
me, gone I do not know where, in the possession
of that Canton dog, Sam Wing, who&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hist!" breathed McGlory, in a warning voice. "Grattan
doesn't know who has the ruby, and it may be a
good thing if we keep it to ourselves. Don't lose your
nerve. Motor Matt is around, and you can count on
him to do something."</p>

<p>"Motor Matt is both notable and energetic," droned
the mandarin, "but for him to secure the ruby from Sam
Wing is too much to hope for."</p>

<p>"There you're shy a few, Tsan Ti. I'll bet my scalp
against that queue of yours that Matt has already captured
Sam Wing and recovered the Eye of Buddha."</p>

<p>Tsan Ti stirred restlessly.</p>

<p>"Do not deceive me with hope, honorable friend," he
begged.</p>

<p>"Well, listen," and McGlory proceeded to tell Tsan Ti
what had happened at the spring.</p>

<p>Tsan Ti's hopes arose. He had been ready to grasp
at anything, and here McGlory had offered him undreamed-of
encouragement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>"There are many brilliant eyes in the plumage of the
sacred peacock," he murmured, "but by them all, I vow
to you that there is no other youth of such accomplishments
as Motor Matt. And, by the five hundred gods
of the temple at&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Cut it out," grunted McGlory. "You've got Matt and
me into no end of trouble with your foolishness. When
you get that ruby into your hands again, stop fumbling
with it. Pass it over to some one who knows how to
look after it, but don't try the job yourself. This is first-chop
pidgin I'm giving you, Tsan Ti, and I don't know
why I'm handing it out, after the way you hocused
my pard and me with that piece of red glass. But it's
good advice, for all that, and you'd better keep it under
your little black cap."</p>

<p>Tsan Ti relapsed into thoughtful silence. The mumble
of voices continued to creep in through the swinging
vines and the bush tops, but otherwise the quiet that
filled the "pocket" was intense.</p>

<p>The mandarin was first to speak. Leaning toward the
cowboy, he whispered:</p>

<p>"There's a chance, companion of my distress, that we
may be able to make our escape."</p>

<p>"What's the number?" queried the cowboy.</p>

<p>Thereupon the mandarin began revealing the plan that
had formed in his mind. It was the fruit of considerable
reflection and promised well.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">SPRINGING A "COUP."</p>


<p>Stripped of its ornamental trimmings, the mandarin's
plan was marvelously simple. McGlory was to roll over
with his back to him, and he engaged to gnaw through
the knife laniard. When the cowboy's hands were free
it would be only a few moments until he removed the
ropes from his ankles and set Tsan Ti at liberty.</p>

<p>This accomplished, McGlory was to set up a racket,
calling Grattan, Bunce, and Pardo into the pocket. As
they crashed through the brush in one direction, the
mandarin would crash through it in another, reach the
motor cycles, and rush away on one before Grattan or
his companions had an opportunity to use their firearms.</p>

<p>"H'm," reflected McGlory. "That's a bully plan, Tsan
Ti&mdash;for you. You're the boy to look out for Number
One, eh? This surprise party you're thinking of springing
reminds me of the way you unloaded that imitation
ruby on Motor Matt, and then sat back and allowed
Matt and me to play tag with Grattan."</p>

<p>"What is the fault with my plan, generous sir?" asked
the mandarin.</p>

<p>"Of course," went on the cowboy, with fine sarcasm,
"I don't amount to much. I kick up a disturbance in
here, and when Grattan, Pardo, and Bunce rush in on
me, you make a run for one of the motor cycles. In other
words, I hold the centre of the stage and make things
interesting for the three tinhorns while you burn the air
on a benzine bike and get as far outdoors as you can.
Fine!"</p>

<p>"Pardon, exalted friend," demurred Tsan Ti, "but you
overlook the point that I will be pursued."</p>

<p>"I don't think I overlook a blessed point, Tsan Ti.
But just answer me this: What's the good of escaping?
Grattan will have to let us go sooner or later. If we
put up with these uncomfortable ropes for a spell, we'll
both get clear and without running the risk of stopping a
bullet."</p>

<p>"Accept my excuses, noble youth, and please remember
Grattan made some remarks about choking me with the
cord in case I did not reveal the whereabouts of the
ruby. That would not be pleasant."</p>

<p>"Sufferin' stranglers!" exclaimed McGlory; "I'd forgotten
about that. Can't say that I blame you for thinking
twice for yourself and once for me. I'll help on the
game." The cowboy rolled over with his back to the
mandarin. "Now get busy with your teeth," he added,
"and be in a rush. There's no telling when the pallavering
outside will be over with, and if those fellows get
through before we do, the kibosh will be on us and not
on them."</p>

<p>The logic of this last remark was not lost upon the
mandarin. He grunted and wheezed and used his teeth
with frantic energy. While he panted and labored, both
he and the cowboy kept their ears sharp for the mumble
of talk going on outside.</p>

<p>Fortunately for the <i>coup</i> the prisoners were intending
to spring, the talk continued unabated. The laniard was
gnawed in half, and McGlory sat up, brought his hands
around in front of him, and rubbed the places where the
mandarin's sharp teeth had slipped from the cord.</p>

<p>"You've turned part of the trick, Tsan Ti," commended
the cowboy; "now watch me do my share."</p>

<p>With his pocket knife he slashed through the coil that
held his feet, and he would then have treated the yellow
cord about the mandarin's wrists in like manner had he
not been stopped by a quick word.</p>

<p>"The yellow cord, illustrious one," said the Chinaman,
"must be untied. It is a present from his imperial highness,
my regent, and I may yet be obliged to use it in
the customary way."</p>

<p>"Oh, hang your regent!" grumbled McGlory, but
yielded to the mandarin's request and began untying the
cord with his fingers.</p>

<p>This was slow work, for McGlory's fingers were still
numb from the effects of his own bonds. In due course,
however, the cord was removed, and the Chinaman lifted
himself to a sitting posture. The cowboy used the knife
on the rope that secured Tsan Ti's feet, while the latter
was solicitously coiling up the yard of yellow cord and
putting it away in his pocket.</p>

<p>"Now, courageous friend," whispered the mandarin,
getting up noiselessly and stepping to the swinging green
barrier at the mouth of the niche, "we are ready."</p>

<p>"You know how to manage a motor cycle?" queried
McGlory, suddenly stifling the roar that was almost on
his lips.</p>

<p>"Excellently well, superlative one."</p>

<p>"Then good luck to you. Here goes."</p>

<p>Above the fearsome commotion McGlory made, the
words "Help!" and "Hurry!" might have been distinguished.
Startled exclamations came from the automobile,
followed by a sound of scrambling as the three
thieves tumbled out. Then there was a crashing among
the bushes and the vines, and McGlory rolled back at
full length and shoved his unbound hands under him.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" cried Grattan, who was first to
enter the pocket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mandarin tried to knife me!" whooped McGlory.
"Why didn't you take his knife away from him? I
might have been sent over the one-way trail if I hadn't
yelled."</p>

<p>All three of the men were in the niche by that time.</p>

<p>"Where is the chink?" shouted Grattan.</p>

<p>The poppety-pop-pop of a motor in quick action came
from without.</p>

<p>"He's tripped his anchor and is makin' off!" yelled
Bunce.</p>

<p>"Stop him!" fumed Grattan, and instantly he followed
Bunce and Pardo back through the swinging screen of
vines and bushes.</p>

<p>Chuckling with delight, McGlory leaped erect, sprang
to the vines, and parted them so he could look out.</p>

<p>Tsan Ti, his motor working splendidly, was streaking
down the ravine toward the road. Bunce, who had led
in the rush from the pocket, had mounted the other
motor cycle and was coaxing his engine into action with
the pedal.</p>

<p>"Catch him, Bunce!" bellowed Grattan.</p>

<p>Bunce's answer was lost in a series of explosions as his
motor got to work. As he whirled away, Grattan and
Pardo ran after him to watch the pursuit as long as
possible.</p>

<p>And thus it chanced that good luck came McGlory's
way, after all. He had pretended, when Grattan and
the other two came into the pocket, that he was tied,
and the excitement following Bunce's discovery that the
mandarin was escaping prevented any examination of
the cowboy's bonds. Now McGlory had the neighborhood
of the pocket to himself, and within a dozen feet of
where he stood was the blue touring car, unguarded!</p>

<p>A daring plan rushed through the cowboy's head.
Why not crank up the automobile's engine and rush down
the ravine?</p>

<p>There was a chance that he could reach the road.
If Grattan or Pardo got in his way, he could run them
down; if they drew off to one side and fired at him, he
could trust to luck.</p>

<p>"Nothing venture, nothing win!" muttered the reckless
cowboy, and pushed through the vines and bushes
and jumped for the front of the car.</p>

<p>An angle of the ravine hid Grattan and Pardo. One
look made McGlory certain on this point, and another
look showed him the rough surface which the automobile
had to get over. There was a fine chance to blow
up a tire or come to grief against a jutting rock, but the
cowboy had staked everything on a single throw, and
he was not to be frightened by difficulties.</p>

<p>He gave the crank a couple of turns, and the engine
answered with a fierce sputter and an increasing rattle of
explosions.</p>

<p>That sound, if Grattan and Pardo were near enough
to hear, advertised plainly what McGlory was about. He
lost not a moment in scrambling into the driver's seat
and getting the car to going.</p>

<p>The automobile started with a jump, and lurched and
swayed over the uneven ground like a ship in a storm.
Bending to the steering wheel, McGlory nursed the car
onward with the spark.</p>

<p>The machine rounded the turn. The road was in
plain view&mdash;but so were Grattan and Pardo.</p>

<p>Consternation was written large in the faces of the
two thieves. The car was being hurled toward them,
plunging and buck-jumping as it met the high places, and
the two men had to throw themselves sideways to clear
the path.</p>

<p>"Stop!" roared Grattan, drawing a revolver.</p>

<p>McGlory's answer was a defiant yell. As the car
rushed by Pardo he made a jump for it&mdash;and was knocked
roughly back toward the ravine wall.</p>

<p><i>Bang!</i></p>

<p>That was Grattan's weapon, echoing high about the
racket of the unmuffled motor. Something ripped
through the rear of the top and crooned its wicked song
within an inch of McGlory's head.</p>

<p>But the cowboy laughed. He hadn't blown up a tire
or smashed any of the machinery, he was turning into
the road, and Grattan and Pardo were behind him!</p>

<p>"We've knocked the hoodoo galley west!" McGlory
exulted. "Oh, what do you think of this! <i>What</i> do you
think of it!" and he let the sixty champing horses under
the bonnet snatch him along the road at their best clip.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">MOTOR MATT'S CHASE.</p>


<p>Meanwhile, the king of the motor boys, without the
remotest idea as to what was happening to his cowboy
pard, was exacting his own tribute from the realm
of exciting events.</p>

<p>When he started after Sam Wing, Matt had no time
to give to any one else. He supposed that McGlory was
following him, but was altogether too busy to look behind
and make sure. It was a trifling matter, anyhow.
The main thing was to catch Sam Wing, and Matt threw
himself into the pursuit with ardor.</p>

<p>McGlory, it will be remembered, had worked upon the
theory that the Chinaman, eager to get as far from the
road as possible, had gone over the hill. But this was
incorrect. Sam Wing hustled along the hillside slope,
his course paralleling the valley and the road.</p>

<p>Very early in the chase the Chinaman lost his grass
sandals, and a little later his stockings, but loss of his
footwear seemed to help rather than diminish his speed.</p>

<p>Motor Matt was "no slouch" as a long-distance runner,
but Sam Wing proved a handful for him. From
time to time Matt would gain, coming so close to the
hustling Celestial that he shouted a call for him to stop,
but the Chinaman, gathering himself together for a spurt,
ducked away to his usual lead, and the chase went merrily
on.</p>

<p>Once Matt nearly had him. A section of treacherous
bank broke away under Sam Wing's feet, and the pursued
man flung up his arms and dropped straight downward.
Matt paused on the brink and looked below for
three or four yards to a little shelf gouged from the
bankside. Sam Wing, scarred and apparently senseless,
was lying sprawled on the shelf.</p>

<p>Matt slipped and slid downward, fairly certain that
he was at the end of his exciting trail; but, just as
his feet struck the shelf, the Chinaman rolled over the
edge and carromed away in a break-neck descent that
finally plunged him into the road.</p>

<p>This was the identical road that led past the spring,
and Matt and Sam Wing were somewhere between the
spring and Gardenville. Where Martin was with the
automobile, Matt did not know, but if Martin had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
at that point in the road when the Chinaman rolled into
it, an easy capture could have been made.</p>

<p>There was some one in the road besides Sam Wing,
however, and the traveler was an old colored man, riding
toward Gardenville on a mule. The mule and the colored
man were about a hundred feet away from Wing
when he got to his feet. As soon as the Chinaman's
eyes rested on the long-eared brute and its aged rider,
he started at speed in their direction.</p>

<p>Matt jumped into the road with less than twenty-five
feet between himself and Sam Wing. Once more he
deceived himself with the idea that the chase was narrowing
to a close.</p>

<p>The mule, throwing its head and swinging its long
ears, was ambling leisurely along the way. The old
darky appeared to be in a doze.</p>

<p>Matt, divining Sam Wing's intentions, gave vent to a
warning yell. The darky aroused himself and flung a
look over his shoulder. But it was too late, for Wing
had already grabbed him by one of his dangling feet.
Another moment and the negro had been roughly pulled
into the road. Wing scrambled to the mule's back and
dug into the animal with his naked heels. Probably the
mule was as startled as his former rider, for he broke
into a lumbering lope.</p>

<p>The chase, just then, took on a hopeless outlook for
Motor Matt. If Martin had only happened along in
the automobile, the fleeing Chinaman could have been
brought up with a round turn, but Matt, with only his
feet under him, could not hope to overtake the galloping
mule.</p>

<p>The darky, as Matt came up with him, was gathering
in his ragged hat and climbing to an upright position.
He wore a look of puzzled astonishment.</p>

<p>"Ain't dat scan'lous?" he cried. "Ah done been
slammed into de road by er Chinymum! En he's got
mah mu-el! He's er runnin' erway wif mah Gin'ral
Jackson mu-el. By golly, whaffur kind ob way is dat
tuh treat an ole moke lak me?"</p>

<p>"It was pretty rough, uncle, and that's a fact," replied
Matt, smothering an inclination to laugh at the
ludicrous picture the old negro presented. "If we had
another mule, I could catch the rascal, but it is too
much of a job for me with nothing to ride."</p>

<p>"You chasin' dat 'ar Chinymum, boss?" inquired the
darky.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Has he been up tuh somefin' dat he hadn't ort?"</p>

<p>"He has."</p>

<p>"Den yo' lis'en heah, chile," and a slow grin crept
over the wizened, ebony face of the negro. "Erbout er
mile ahead dar's a bridge ovah a creek, en dat 'ar Chinyman
ain't gwine tuh ride Gin'ral Jackson ovah dat
bridge."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"'Case dat fool mu-el won't cross no bridge if yo'
doan' cotch his off eah en give hit a pull. Mu-els is
mouty queer daterway, en Gin'ral Jackson is a heap
queerer dan any othah mu-el yo' most evah see. He's
skeered ob a bridge, en pullin' his off eah done takes
his min' off'n de bridge, lak, en he goes ovah wifout
mistrustin'. Now, dat yalluh Chinymum trash doan'
know dat, en ef he try to mek Gin'ral Jackson cross de
bridge wifout pullin' his off eah, dar's suah gwine to be
doin's, en&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Just at that moment a boy came along on a bicycle.
He was evidently making a long journey, for he had
a bag strapped to the handle bars.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute!" called Matt to the boy.</p>

<p>The bicycle halted, and the lad rested one foot on the
ground and looked inquiringly at Matt.</p>

<p>"I wish you'd lend me your wheel for a few minutes,"
said Matt. "A Chinaman just stole this old darky's mule,
and I believe I can overhaul the thief if you'll let me
take your bicycle."</p>

<p>"Gee!" exclaimed the boy. "How much of a start
has the Chinaman got?"</p>

<p>"About three minutes. The darky says there's a bridge
a mile ahead, and that the mule won't cross the bridge
unless he's coaxed. Perhaps I can come up with the
thief at the bridge."</p>

<p>"There you are," said the stranger generously, getting
out of the saddle and holding the wheel for Matt.</p>

<p>"Much obliged," returned Matt. "You and the darky
come on to the bridge, and perhaps you'll find me rounding
up the mule and the Chinaman."</p>

<p>"We'll do it," was the answer.</p>

<p>Matt mounted easily, thrust his toes into the toe clips,
and got under way. When he turned an angle of the
road, and vanished behind a screen of timber, he was
going like a steam engine.</p>

<p>It had been a long time since Matt had ridden an
ordinary bicycle, but he had by no means forgotten the
knack. He was not long in coming within sight of
the bridge, and there, sure enough, were the Chinaman
and the mule at the bridge approach.</p>

<p>The Chinaman was having trouble. General Jackson
would not cross the bridge, and he was braced back, immovable
as the rock of Gibraltar. Sam Wing was using
his heels and the flat of his hand in a furious attempt
to force the brute onward. General Jackson did not
budge an inch, but, from the way he wagged his ears, it
was evident that his wrath was growing.</p>

<p>Matt remained silent and bent to the pedals. While
Sam Wing was busy urging the mule, Matt was planning
to come alongside and treat the Celestial as he had
treated the old negro.</p>

<p>This design might have been successfully executed had
not General Jackson interfered with it. The mule's
temper suddenly gave way under the rain of kicks and
blows, and he put his head down between his forelegs and
hoisted the rear half of his body into the air. The man&oelig;uvre
was as sudden as it was unexpected, and Sam
Wing went rocketing into space.</p>

<p>The bridge was merely a plank affair, without any
guard rails at the sides, and after the Chinaman had
done a couple of somersaults in the air he landed with
a thump on the bridge, close to the unprotected edge.
He started to struggle upright, and the hurried movement
caused him to slip over the brink.</p>

<p>He vanished from before Matt's eyes just as he had
disappeared from the caving bank&mdash;there was a flutter, a
yell, a splash, and Sam Wing was gone.</p>

<p>Matt threw on the brake, jumped from the wheel, and,
after leaning the machine against a tree, rushed to the
bridge.</p>

<p>The creek was narrow, but seemed to be deep, and
the Chinaman was floating down with the current.</p>

<p>There was no time for Matt to linger and explain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
events to the bicyclist and the negro. Each would recover
his property, however, and that ought to satisfy
both of them. Springing from the bridge approach,
Matt hurried down the bank of the little stream.</p>

<p>The Chinaman, the king of the motor boys thought,
must have been made of india rubber to bear so well
the series of mishaps that had come his way. He came
out of every one with astonishing ability to keep up
his flight.</p>

<p>Matt's rush down the creek bank was not continued
for long. Sam Wing saw him and made haste to effect
a landing on the opposite bank. He emerged, a dripping
and forlorn spectacle, and left a damp trail up the bank
and into the woods.</p>

<p>Matt did not care to swim the creek in his clothes,
and a tree, fallen partly over the stream, afforded him
an opportunity to cross dry-shod. The tree was not a
large one, and there was a gap of water at the end of
it, where the trunk had been splintered and broken
away.</p>

<p>With a clear, steady brain and sure feet the king of
the motor boys passed to the end of his swaying, insecure
bridge; then, with a leap, he cleared the stretch
of water and landed on the bank. The force he had
put into the jump displaced the tree and caused it to
tumble into the creek. It had served its purpose, however,
and Matt, without a backward look, tore away
along the watery trail of the Chinaman.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE CHASE CONCLUDED.</p>


<p>When Matt came near enough to see Sam Wing, it
seemed plain that the Celestial was yielding to the "blows
of circumstance." His flight dragged. Time and time
again he cast a wild look over his shoulder at the relentless
pursuer, and tried in vain to increase his pace.</p>

<p>His random course crossed a road through the timber
with a line of telegraph or telephone poles on one side
of it. After a moment's hesitation, Sam Wing chose
the road. It was easier going, no doubt, and for that
reason probably appealed to him in his fagged condition.</p>

<p>But if it was easier for Sam Wing, so was it for Matt.
Now, at last, the eventful chase was certainly approaching
its finish.</p>

<p>As the pursuit went on, Matt resolutely closing up the
gap between him and the Chinaman, the timber suddenly
broke away to give a view of a farmhouse and a barn.
Between the house and barn stood a farmer with a rake.</p>

<p>Sam Wing, at the end of his rope and apparently
determined on making a last desperate stand, swerved
from the road and ran in the direction of the barn.</p>

<p>"Hi, there!" shouted Matt, waving his arms to attract
the attention of the farmer, "head him off!"</p>

<p>It was not difficult for the farmer to understand enough
of the situation to make him useful in the emergency,
and he started energetically to do what he could. Swinging
the rake around his head, he hurried toward a
point which would intersect the path of the Chinaman.</p>

<p>Sam Wing, even though he was weary and almost
spent, continued "game." A small, V-shaped hencoop
stood close to the point where he halted and confronted
the farmer.</p>

<p>"By Jerry," threatened the farmer, "yew stop! Don't
yew try no shenanigin with me, or I'll comb out your
pigtail with this here rake. What yew&mdash;&mdash; Gosh-all-hemlocks!"</p>

<p>It was absolutely necessary for Sam Wing to do something
if he did not want to be trapped between the
farmer in front and Matt, who was hurrying up behind.
Calling upon all his strength, Wing stooped, grabbed the
small coop, and hurled it at the farmer's legs.</p>

<p>The coop struck the farmer's shins and doubled his
lank frame up like a closed jackknife. He went down,
rake and all, and Wing passed around him and lumbered
on toward the open barn door.</p>

<p>The farmer's ire was aroused. Getting up on his
knees, he began calling, at the top of his lungs: "Tige!
Here, Tige!"</p>

<p>Tige, a brindled bulldog, came scurrying from the
direction of the house.</p>

<p>"Take 'im, Tige!" bellowed the farmer, pointing toward
Sam Wing with the rake.</p>

<p>The Chinaman's Waterloo was close upon him. He
had time to give one last frantic look behind, and then
Tige caught him by the slack of his dripping garments
and pulled him down.</p>

<p>"Don't let the dog hurt him!" yelled Matt.</p>

<p>"Watch 'im, Tige!" cried the farmer. "Good dorg,
Tige! Watch 'im!"</p>

<p>The farmer got up and gave the hencoop a vicious kick.</p>

<p>"Jee-whillikins, mister," said he, "what's that slant-eyed
heathen been up to, hey? He looks like he'd
dropped outen a wet rag bag."</p>

<p>"He's a thief," answered Matt.</p>

<p>"He barked my shins somethin' turrible with that hencoop.
But yew got him now, an' don't yew fergit it.
That Tige is the best dorg fer tramps an' sich yew ever
seen."</p>

<p>Together they walked to the place where Tige, growling
savagely and showing his teeth, was standing over
the prone Chinaman.</p>

<p>Sam Wing dared not make a move. Had he so much
as lifted a finger, the bulldog would have been at his
throat.</p>

<p>"Order the dog away," said Matt to the farmer. "I
want to talk with the Chinaman, and we'll take him into
the barn where we can both sit down on something and
rest a little. We've had a hard chase."</p>

<p>The farmer spoke to the dog and the animal slunk
away, still keeping his glittering eyes on Sam Wing.</p>

<p>"Looks purty meachin', don't he?" muttered the
farmer, peering at the prisoner.</p>

<p>"He's a bad Chinaman," returned Matt, "and he knows
it. Get up, Sam Wing," he added, "and go into the
barn. Don't try to do any more running. You haven't
strength enough to go far, and it won't be best for you."</p>

<p>With wary eyes on the dog, Wing got up and moved
toward the barn door. When they were all inside, Matt
took down a coil of rope that swung from a nail and
started toward the prisoner.</p>

<p>"What yew goin' to do, friend?" asked the farmer.</p>

<p>"Tie him," replied Matt.</p>

<p>"That ain't necessary. Tige is better'n all the ropes
that was ever made. All I got ter do is ter tell him ter
watch the heathen, an' yew can bet a pair o' gum boots
he'll do it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>The farmer spoke to the dog, that had followed them
into the barn, and the animal drew close to Sam Wing
and sat down within biting distance. Matt, satisfied with
the arrangement for the time being, dropped the rope
and seated himself on the tongue of a wagon.</p>

<p>"Sam Wing," said the king of the motor boys severely,
"you're a mighty bad Chinaman."</p>

<p>"Me savvy," answered Wing, whose English was far
from being as good as the mandarin's.</p>

<p>"You stole the ruby from Tsan Ti," went on Matt.</p>

<p>Sam Wing had strength enough left to show some
surprise.</p>

<p>"How you savvy?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"I know it, and that's enough. You're a treacherous
scoundrel to turn against the mandarin as you did."</p>

<p>"All same," answered Sam Wing, in extreme dejection.
"Ten thousand demons makee heap tlouble fol Wing.
Me plenty solly."</p>

<p>"You ought to be sorry. Tsan Ti trusted you with
his money and had a lot of confidence in you. And you
betrayed that confidence."</p>

<p>Sam Wing groaned heavily and caressed his numerous
bruises. One of his hands finally reached the breast of
his torn blouse, and he fished from it a very wet alligator-skin
pouch.</p>

<p>"Here Tsan Ti's money," said he, offering the pouch
to Matt. "Me velly bad Chinaman. You takee money,
lettee Sam Wing go?"</p>

<p>"I'll take the money," and Matt suited his action to the
word, "but I can't let you go until you give up the ruby."</p>

<p>"No gottee luby," came the astonishing assertion from
Sam Wing.</p>

<p>"You took it from the mandarin, didn't you?" demanded
Matt.</p>

<p>"My takee las' night, no gottee now."</p>

<p>"Where is it?"</p>

<p>"Me losee when me makee lun flom spling. No savvy
where me losee&mdash;p'laps where me makee fall down bank,
p'laps on load, p'laps in cleek&mdash;no savvy. Luby gone,
me no gottee Eye of Buddha."</p>

<p>It seemed strange to Matt that Sam Wing could carry
the alligator-skin pouch safely through all his varied adventures
and yet not be able to retain the most valuable
part of his cargo&mdash;the part which, presumably, he would
take care to stow safely.</p>

<p>"Don't tell any lies, Sam Wing!" said Matt sternly.</p>

<p>"No tellee lie&mdash;all same one piecee tluth!" protested
the Chinaman.</p>

<p>"I'll have to make sure of that," went on Matt.</p>

<p>He searched carefully through the Chinaman's torn
and waterlogged apparel, but without discovering anything
of value&mdash;much less the missing gem.</p>

<p>"Where did you have it?" he asked.</p>

<p>Sam Wing showed him the inside pocket where the
ruby had been placed.</p>

<p>"Where have you been since you took the ruby?"</p>

<p>A wave of emotion convulsed the Chinaman's features.</p>

<p>"Evel place," he murmured. "My stay in Galdenville
one piecee time, makee tly keepee 'way flom Tsan Ti.
Bymby me makee lun fol countlee. Tsan Ti makee see,
makee lun, too. My makee hide in hills, foolee Tsan Ti
so he no ketchee. My heap hungly, heap thirsty. Findee
spling to takee dlink. You come."</p>

<p>Sam Wing shook his head sadly.</p>

<p>"You had the ruby when you were at the spring?"
inquired Matt.</p>

<p>The Chinaman nodded.</p>

<p>"And you lost it while I was chasing you?"</p>

<p>Another nod.</p>

<p>Matt, oppressed with what he had heard, and which he
felt instinctively was the truth, resumed his seat on the
wagon tongue.</p>

<p>The ruby might be lying anywhere over the wild course
Sam Wing had taken in his flight. Perhaps it was mixed
with the loose earth of the side hill where the Chinaman
had fallen, or it might be under the leaves in the woods,
or in the dust of the road, or in the bottom of the creek.</p>

<p>Of one thing Matt was sure, and that was that to
retrace the exact line of Sam Wing's flight would be
impossible; and, even if it were possible, finding the
red gem would be as difficult as looking for the proverbial
needle in a haystack.</p>

<p>The Eye of Buddha seemed to be lost irretrievably.
This was like to prove a tragic event for Tsan Ti.</p>

<p>It was strange what ill luck had attended upon all in
any way connected with the idol's eye; and doubly
strange was this final loss of the precious stone.</p>

<p>While Matt was busily turning the catastrophe over in
his mind, the farmer suddenly gave a shout and pointed
through the open barn door and along the road.</p>

<p>"Great sassafrass!" he exclaimed. "I never seen sich
a day fer Chinamen! Look there, will yew?"</p>

<p>Matt looked, and what he saw staggered him. Two
motor cycles were coming down the road. Bunce was
riding one and Tsan Ti the other. Here was another
flight and pursuit, for the sailor was pushing hard upon
the heels of the mandarin.</p>

<p>For only a moment was Matt at loss. Gathering up
the coil of rope which he had taken from the nail in the
barn wall, he called to the farmer to watch the prisoner
and ran out of the barn and toward the road.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">A DOUBLE CAPTURE.</p>


<p>Matt was bewildered by the strange turn events were
taking. Encountering Sam Wing at the spring was odd
enough, in all truth, and the weird happenings during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
his pursuit had been as novel as they were thrilling;
but here, in a most inexplicable way, came the mandarin
and the mariner on motor cycles, wabbling down the
road, Tsan Ti in a panic and Bunce aggressive and determined.</p>

<p>Matt shouted, but the two on the motor cycles were
so deeply immersed in their own efforts that they paid
no attention to the call.</p>

<p>To stop the motor cycles was the first step, and the
young motorist went about it in his usual resourceful
way. Swiftly he secured one end of the rope to a telegraph
pole at the side of the road; then, bounding back,
he took a turn with the free end of the rope around a
convenient tree. Hanging to the cable that was to form
a blockade for the charging wheels, Matt once more gave
his attention to Bunce and Tsan Ti.</p>

<p>The pursuit of the mandarin had reached a crisis. The
sailor had come close enough to reach out and grab the
Chinaman's flying queue, and he was hauling rearward,
pulling the mandarin back until his hands had left the
handle bars.</p>

<p>"Stop!" shouted Motor Matt, laying back on the end
of the rope.</p>

<p>The command was useless, for pursuer and pursued
were obliged to halt in spite of it.</p>

<p>The mandarin's swaying motor cycle was first to hit
the rope. Before the machine could topple over, Bunce
crashed into it. There followed a rasping volley of gasoline
explosions, a roar from the sailor, and a chattering
yell from the mandarin. The two were on the ground,
tangled up with each other and with the motor cycles.</p>

<p>Dropping the rope, Matt rushed at the struggling pair,
seized Bunce by the shoulders, and hauled him out of
the mix-up.</p>

<p>A revolver had fallen from the sailor's pocket. Matt
sprang to secure it, and then faced Bunce, who was on
his knees and staring about him dazedly.</p>

<p>"Noble friend!" cried the mandarin, carefully extricating
his head from the frame of one of the motor
cycles, "you have again preserved the wretched Tsan Ti!
The evil personage yonder would presently have caught
me!"</p>

<p>Bunce, having finally decided that the situation was
one that boded him no good, started to get up and remove
himself from the scene.</p>

<p>"I don't believe you'd better leave us just yet, Bunce,"
called Matt, waving the revolver. "Stay right where
you are. This is a complication which you can help the
mandarin explain."</p>

<p>"By the seven holy spritsails!" muttered Bunce, falling
back in his original position and looking at Matt and
then at the farmer. "How, in the name o' Davy Jones,"
he cried, his gaze returning to Matt, "do you happen to
be cruisin' in these waters?"</p>

<p>"Never mind that, for the present. What I want to
know is, where have you and the mandarin come from?
And why were you chasing him?"</p>

<p>"I have escaped, highly appreciated friend whose kindness
is much reciprocated," babbled the mandarin, coming
blithely to Matt's side and carefully knocking the
dust out of his little black cap. "I have made a never-to-be-forgotten
escape from the hands of evil-minded
enemies. It was your friend from the cattle districts
who helped me."</p>

<p>So far, all that Matt had heard and seen had merely
bogged him the more deeply in a mire of misunderstanding.
At the mandarin's mention of McGlory, his speculations
went off at a wild tangent.</p>

<p>"Did Grattan and Bunce capture the other car?" he
demanded. "Where did you find Joe and Martin?
Where are they now? What's happened to them?"</p>

<p>"Peace, distinguished youth," said the mandarin, putting
on his cap and fluttering his hand reassuringly. "I
know nothing about any car except the blue one by the
pocket."</p>

<p>"Blue car? Did you see a blue car?"</p>

<p>"Even so, my amazed friend. And beside the blue car
leaned those go-devil bicycles. McGlory&mdash;faithful assistant
in my time of need&mdash;helped me beguile Grattan,
Pardo, and Bunce into the pocket, whereupon I secured
one of the go-devil machines and fled swiftly. The one-eyed
sailor followed. Which way we came I do not
know. Wherever I saw another road I turned into it.
How long we raced is too much for my disturbed faculties
to understand. We went, and went, and at last we were
here, and I found you! Oh, loyal defender of the most
wretched of mandarins, to you I owe my peace, my happiness,
and my life! May the six thousand peri of the
land of enchantment afford you joy in the life to come!"</p>

<p>"Well, by gum!" muttered the wide-eyed farmer,
shifting his rake to the other hand and rubbing a palm
against his forehead. "I never seen a heathen that could
talk like that before. Some remarkable now, ain't it?"</p>

<p>Matt was too deeply concerned with what Tsan Ti
had said to pay much attention to the farmer. He kept
his watchful eyes on Bunce, however, while seeking to
get deeper into the perplexing situation that so suddenly
confronted him.</p>

<p>"Let's begin at the beginning, Tsan Ti," said he, "and
try and smooth out the knots of this amazing tangle with
some sort of system. McGlory and I received your telegram.
What happened to you after Sam Wing stole the
ruby?"</p>

<p>"I awoke from my dreams in great fright, inquiring
friend," responded the mandarin, "and found the ruby
gone, and Sam Wing gone. There was but one thing
for me to think, and I thought it. The train was at a
station, and I jumped from the steps. I looked for Sam
Wing, but he had vanished; then I sent my telegram<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
and waited until you might arrive. In the gray dawn
that came into the east, I saw Sam Wing suddenly flash
by the open door of the railroad station. I shouted and
ran after him, but he evaded me. Ah, the dreary heart-sickness
in my breast as I pursued the traitor!" The
mandarin clutched at his frayed yellow blouse and wrung
a fold of it in his fat fingers. "Who can tell of that? I
followed the wagon road through the mountains, looking
and listening. Then I heard some one, afar off, shouting
the name of Motor Matt. Hope leaped high within me,
for that name, notable sir, has a magic of its own. I
turned from the road, climbed many rocks, and crushed
through thick growths of prickly bushes, striving to
reach the one who had shouted. Also, I shouted myself,
and presently, to my great but mistaken delight, other
shoutings were returned to me. I went on, in my deceived
state, and came to a place where I was captured&mdash;made
a prisoner by Grattan and that contemptible mariner
of the single eye! Your friend of the cattle districts
was likewise a prisoner."</p>

<p>"McGlory&mdash;captured by Grattan!" gasped Matt. "How
did that happen? Why, I thought he was with Martin."</p>

<p>"Not so, deceived friend. He had tried to follow you
in the pursuit of Sam Wing, and he had lost knowledge
of his location, and was shouting to hear some speak and
tell him where he was. That is what I heard. Before
I could reach your friend, Grattan and Bunce had also
heard him, and made him a prisoner. Then they heard
me, and made <i>me</i> a captive. Verily, the ten thousand
demons have had me under the ban."</p>

<p>"I'm beginning to get at this," said Matt grimly.
"Where did you and Grattan come from, Bunce, that you
were placed so handily for entrapping McGlory and the
mandarin?"</p>

<p>"We'd made port in the hills," replied Bunce, "an' was
out lookin' for Tsan Ti an' the ruby."</p>

<p>"They, miserable creatures," resumed the mandarin,
with a glance of contempt at Bunce, "had the blue car
and the go-devil bicycles in a gashed-out spot among the
mountains. A cavern, named by them a pocket, was in
the wall of the rough valley. There were McGlory and
I taken and bound. While Grattan, Bunce, and Pardo,
birds of evil feather, were plotting in the blue car, I
gnawed the cord that secured your unfortunate friend's
hands, and he freed himself and me. After that McGlory
raised a great clamor. Grattan, Bunce, and Pardo came
hastily to observe what might be the trouble, and I went
out of the pocket as they came in. Then I took the
motor cycle, as I have said, and moved away, followed by
the mariner. Is the matter clear, esteemed friend?"</p>

<p>"I'm beginning to understand it," answered Matt.
"It's the queerest mix-up I ever heard of. Strange that
you and Joe should fall into the hands of Grattan and
Bunce, as you did, and that you should happen to lead
Bunce this way when you fled on the motor cycle."</p>

<p>"Matter-of-fact youth," remarked the mandarin earnestly,
"do you not realize how strange events happen
swiftly in the wake of the Eye of Buddha? The ten
thousand demons are doing their worst continually, and
their powers for evil are vast beyond imagining!"</p>

<p>"We'll pass over that phase of the matter," said Matt
dryly, "and try to get at something that will benefit
McGlory. Can you take me to this 'pocket,' as you
call it?"</p>

<p>"Not so," replied the mandarin. "I have no recollection
how I came from it, or what roads I took. The
roads were many, and the way was long, and my mind
was too greatly disturbed to pay attention."</p>

<p>"Where's the pocket, Bunce?" asked Matt, addressing
the sailor.</p>

<p>"I know, messmate," scowled Bunce, "but I'm not
showin' ye the course."</p>

<p>Matt was in a quandary. He could not understand
why Grattan had captured McGlory, but he was not intending
to let his chum remain any longer in the hands
of the thieves than was absolutely necessary. A way
would be found to make Bunce lead him to the pocket.</p>

<p>"Generous and agreeable friend," spoke up Tsan Ti,
"did you succeed in capturing Sam Wing?"</p>

<p>"I did," replied Matt.</p>

<p>"Then may I request of you the Eye of Buddha?"</p>

<p>"I'll take you to Sam Wing and you can request it of
him," said Matt. "Get up, Bunce," he ordered, "and
start yourself for the barn. Will you," and Matt shot a
glance at the farmer, "kindly remove that rope from the
road and set the motor cycles upright in a place where
they will be safe?"</p>

<p>"Glad to do anythin' fer yew that I can," answered the
farmer, dropping his rake and getting busy with the rope.</p>

<p>Matt, face to face with the ordeal of acquainting Tsan
Ti with the fact that the ruby was irretrievably lost, was
wondering, as he drove Bunce toward the barn, what the
result of the catastrophe was to be.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">ANOTHER SURPRISE.</p>


<p>Bunce was accepting his hard luck with all the complaisance
he could muster. His pursuit of the mandarin
had led him into difficulties undreamed of, but he still
indulged a hope that the resourceful Grattan might come
to his aid. He went into the barn, and recoiled a little
as a savage growl struck on his ears. Tige was still
guarding Sam Wing.</p>

<p>"Sit down," said Matt, to Bunce, nodding toward some
bags of ground feed lying on the barn floor. "The dog
won't molest you; he's looking after Sam Wing."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>Bunce, plainly uncomfortable, seated himself, watching
Tige warily.</p>

<p>The instant Tsan Ti came through the barn door and
saw Sam Wing, a cry of rage burst from his lips, and he
flew at his treacherous servant. Matt grabbed the angry
mandarin and held him back.</p>

<p>"That won't do, Tsan Ti," said Matt. "Sit down and
take things calmly. There's your money," and he
pointed to the alligator-skin pouch which lay by the
wagon tongue. "Sam Wing turned it over to me. You'd
better count it and make sure it's all there. Hereafter, it
would be wise for you to take care of your money yourself."</p>

<p>Tsan Ti glared at Sam Wing, then stooped down, and
recovered the pouch. The receptacle was filled with
soggy banknotes, and, while the mandarin was fingering
them over, he kept up a running fire of talk in Chinese.
The condemnation must have been of the most scathing
sort, for the wretched Sam Wing shivered as he listened.</p>

<p>Presently Sam Wing himself began to talk. He spoke
at length, and must have been acquainting the mandarin
with the dread fact that the Eye of Buddha was lost,
for, suddenly, Tsan Ti dropped the alligator-skin pouch
and the wet bills and reeled back against the barn wall.
His eyes became glassy and his face turned white.</p>

<p>Presently he sank down on the barn floor, listless and
staring.</p>

<p>"Has he told you about the ruby, Tsan Ti?" asked
Matt, his pity for the mandarin rising paramount to any
other feeling he may have cherished against him.</p>

<p>Tsan Ti did not answer; in fact, he did not seem to
hear. He had suffered a blow that paralyzed his faculties.</p>

<p>"Blow me tight!" breathed Bunce, astonished. "Hasn't
he got the ruby?"</p>

<p>"Didn't Grattan search him?" returned Matt.</p>

<p>"Ah, he looked through his pockets and his sandals,
and even tried to find the Eye of Buddha in his queue,
but it wasn't there. For all that, we thought the chink
knowed where the stone was an' could be made to tell."</p>

<p>"He knew where it was&mdash;Sam Wing had it."</p>

<p>"Hocused it?"</p>

<p>"Stole it&mdash;then lost it!"</p>

<p>"Shiver me!" exclaimed Bunce, aghast. "Then Tsan
Ti ain't got the ruby, an' Grattan won't never be able
to put hands on it!"</p>

<p>"It's gone for good," answered Matt. "Now you can
see, Bunce, just how much good Grattan's trickery and
double-dealing has benefited him. You and he stole the
ruby from the Honam joss house and brought it to
America; Tsan Ti followed you, under orders from the
regent of China to recover the idol's eye or else to
strangle himself with the yellow cord; the ruby was recovered
for Tsan Ti here in the Catskills, but Grattan
kept up his wild scheming and committed one piece of
lawless villainy after another in his attempts to get the
ruby away from Tsan Ti; now we're at the end of the
whole business, and neither Grattan nor Tsan Ti has the
ruby, or will ever have it."</p>

<p>Just at that moment the farmer came into the barn.</p>

<p>"I got them machines where they'll be safe," he announced,
"an'&mdash;&mdash; Gosh all Whittaker! What's the fat
Chinaman doin'?"</p>

<p>Matt turned to look at Tsan Ti. He had the yellow
cord around his throat, rove into a running bowline, and
was pulling at the loose end.</p>

<p>The king of the motor boys hurried to him and jerked
his hands from the cord with a quick movement.</p>

<p>"That will do, Tsan Ti!" cried Matt sternly. "Can't
you be a man? You're not going to strangle yourself
while I'm around!"</p>

<p>"There is no hope for Tsan Ti," mumbled the mandarin.
"The august decree of my regent&mdash;may his years
be many and glorious!&mdash;calls for my quick dispatch."</p>

<p>Matt pulled the cord from the mandarin's neck.</p>

<p>"Listen, Tsan Ti," said he; "don't give up until you
know the case is really hopeless. We can go back over
the ground Sam Wing covered while I was chasing him,
and it is possible we can find the ruby."</p>

<p>"Not possible, deluded friend," answered the mandarin.
"The contemptible Canton dog says the gem may
be in the water, or in many other places where its recovery
is out of the question. The blandishments of hope
pale into the heavy darkness of my certain destruction.
Present me with the cord, I beg of you. Tsan Ti, mandarin
of the red button, is not afraid to join his exalted
ancestors in the country dear to true believers."</p>

<p>"Wrong in the upper story, ain't he?" put in the
farmer.</p>

<p>"In a way," replied Matt.</p>

<p>"He sure had himself goin' with that piece o' yellow
string. Them heathens is queer, anyway."</p>

<p>"I'll not give you this cord, Tsan Ti," declared Matt,
"until I can look over the course followed by Sam
Wing and make an attempt to find the ruby."</p>

<p>"There are other means for performing the quick
dispatch," said Tsan Ti calmly. "I prefer the cord; it
is an honor to use an instrument direct from the regent's
hands; but, if the cord is not at hand, other means will
avail me, ungenerous youth."</p>

<p>Matt studied the mandarin for a few moments. In his
eyes he read determination. Matt, matter-of-fact American
lad that he was, could not understand the Oriental
custom now exemplified by Tsan Ti&mdash;he could not understand
the thousands of years' usage which had made the
custom part of a Chinaman's faith, and he had nothing
but contempt for the exhibition the mandarin was making
of himself.</p>

<p>"Get the rope, please," said Matt to the farmer. "I
think we'll use it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>The farmer brought the rope, and Matt, with his assistance,
tied Tsan Ti's hands and feet. The mandarin
yielded passively.</p>

<p>"This will not serve," was all he said; "the time for
my dispatch will arrive, in spite of you."</p>

<p>"If you keep on acting in this foolish way, Tsan Ti,"
answered Matt, "I'll lose all the respect I ever had for
you. Face the music, can't you? There's no merit in
throwing up your hands and quitting just because you
have run into a streak of hard luck."</p>

<p>"You don't understand, ignorant one."</p>

<p>"I understand, fast enough, that you can't hurt yourself
while you're tied up."</p>

<p>He turned away.</p>

<p>"Do you think Tige can watch two prisoners?" he
asked of the farmer.</p>

<p>"Yew bet he can," answered the farmer enthusiastically,
"two 'r a dozen. Why, that dorg's quicker'n
chain lightnin'."</p>

<p>"Then," went on Matt, "just give Tige to understand
that he's to watch the sailor, as well as that other Chinaman."</p>

<p>The farmer spoke to the dog, and the animal took up
a position between Sam Wing and Bunce. The sailor
tried to draw back, but Tige stopped the movement with
a savage snarl and a half move as though he would bite.</p>

<p>"Keelhaul me!" cried Bunce. "Is this what ye call
treatin' a feller white? Why, I wouldn't treat a Hottentot
swab like this!"</p>

<p>"I've got you, Bunce," said Matt grimly, "and, no
matter what becomes of Grattan and Pardo, the law
won't be cheated entirely."</p>

<p>"What've I done that ye can send me to the brig for?
Tell me that!"</p>

<p>"Isn't the theft of the ruby enough to send you to
jail?"</p>

<p>"That happened in Chiny, an' we're in America now."</p>

<p>"Well, putting that aside, there remains the criminal
work you did at the Catskill garage last night. You
can be sent to the penitentiary for that, Bunce."</p>

<p>That was a blow that left Bunce gasping.</p>

<p>"Grattan done that," he cried; "it wasn't me planned
it."</p>

<p>"You helped Grattan, Bunce, and you were recognized
by the night man. There's a clear case against you, and
you'll deserve all the punishment you receive."</p>

<p>"Say," said Bunce, with a sudden inspiration, "if ye'll
let me go, I'll take ye to that pocket where McGlory is!
I'll do more'n that, sink me if I won't! You let me slip
my hawse and slant away clear o' these hills, an' I'll help
ye git McGlory away from Grattan an' Pardo. What
d'ye say, mate? It ain't a job ye could do alone, an' it
ain't a place ye can find onless I show the way. What's
the word?"</p>

<p>"I've had enough experience with you, Bunce," returned
Matt, "to know that you're not to be depended
on. You'd play some treacherous trick that would&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here a voice&mdash;a very familiar voice&mdash;came floating
through the open barn door.</p>

<p>"Whoop-ya! Any one around? Show up, somebody,
and tell me where I am and how to go to get to the
spring on the trail from Catskill to Gardenville!
Whoo-ee!"</p>

<p>"Woods is full o' strangers to-day, seems like!" exclaimed
the farmer.</p>

<p>Matt bolted past him through the door, then halted,
and gazed spellbound at a blue automobile with Joe
McGlory in the driver's seat.</p>

<p>This might have been considered the culminating surprise
of the day's events. And it was a mutual surprise,
too, judging by the way McGlory acted.</p>

<p>Leaning over the steering wheel, the cowboy gazed like
one in a trance.</p>

<p>"Matt!" he shouted at last, "is this a dream, or the
real thing? Say something, you old hardshell. Sufferin'
tenterhooks! I can't tell how nervous you make me."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">BAITING A TRAP.</p>


<p>"Is that the New York man's automobile, Joe?" asked
Matt, "the one that was stolen from Martin's garage
last night?'</p>

<p>"It's the one, pard," jubilated the cowboy. "I've come
through a-smoking with it from that place where Grattan
had me pocketed with the mandarin. It's queer I
stopped here, although I'm off my bearings, haven't the
least notion where I am, and this is the first farmhouse
I've seen for a dozen miles; but it won't seem quite so
queer when I tell you that I saw those machines leaning
against the corncrib, and that the familiar look of 'em
brought me in to stir up the natives and ask a few questions."</p>

<p>McGlory pointed toward a corncrib off at the rear of
the barn. The two motor cycles were leaning against the
structure, just where the farmer had left them.</p>

<p>"I see," said Matt.</p>

<p>"Are those motor cycles the ones that belong to Martin,
that were stolen from us and that we bled a hundred
and fifty apiece for?"</p>

<p>"They're the ones."</p>

<p>"Well, now!" chuckled McGlory, "what sort of a day's
work would you call this, pard? We get back the stolen
automobile and both motor cycles. I'm ready to hear
the whistle blow."</p>

<p>"There's something else to be done before we finish
this piece of work, Joe."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>"Tell me about it."</p>

<p>"Sam Wing is in the barn, there&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Whoop! Then you <i>did</i> get the kibosh on him, after
all!"</p>

<p>"And Tsan Ti," proceeded Matt, "and Bunce."</p>

<p>"Better and better; but I'd almost guessed that just
from seeing the motor cycles. What have you been doing
since we went two different ways from the spring?"</p>

<p>The king of the motor boys sketched rapidly the main
points of Sam Wing's flight and the pursuit, following
with the blockade of the road and the capture of Bunce.</p>

<p>"And Tsan Ti is in the barn this minute," finished
Matt, "roped hand and foot to keep him from taking his
own life on account of the lost ruby. If possible, I'd
like to go over the course of Wing's flight and look for
the Eye of Buddha."</p>

<p>"Might as well look for a nickel in the Pacific Ocean,"
scowled McGlory.</p>

<p>"It looks like a hopeless case, I'll admit, but I can't
leave the poor old mandarin without trying to do something
for him."</p>

<p>"You're too easy with the crafty old heathen."</p>

<p>"You'd be sorry for him, too, Joe, if you could see
what a plight he's in."</p>

<p>"He was as hard-looking a sight as I ever saw when
he fell into Grattan's clutches a few hours ago. If
you're bound to go rainbow-chasing after the Eye of
Buddha, why, of course I'm in on the deal. We'll have
to be about it, I reckon, while we've got daylight to
help."</p>

<p>"We can use this car for a part of the work. Wing
came along the road from that direction."</p>

<p>Matt pointed as he spoke.</p>

<p>"Why," said McGlory, "I came from that direction
myself. I don't reckon it's safe to go back that way."</p>

<p>"Not safe?" echoed Matt. "Why isn't it safe?"</p>

<p>"Mainly for the reason, pard, that Grattan and Pardo
are trailing this car. They didn't like to lose it. That
hole through the back"&mdash;and McGlory turned to point it
out&mdash;"was made by a bullet that Grattan sent after me.
I've been traveling roads that automobiles never took before,
and the marks this car left would make easy trailing."</p>

<p>"Do you know positively that Grattan and Pardo are
following the car?"</p>

<p>"Well, yes, if you want to pin me down. One of the
electric terminals got loose when I was a short distance
away from the pocket, and I had a time finding out what
was wrong. While I was groping around, I saw Grattan
and Pardo chasing toward me. They were a good ways
off, but if you want a picture of a chap in a hurry you
ought to've had a snapshot of me! I was lucky enough
to find the loose wire just in time to screw it to the post,
crank up, and fly. The tinhorns were within a hundred
feet of the blue car when we jumped away on the high
speed. And that's how I know Grattan and Pardo are
after me. Besides, now that the motor cycles are gone,
those fellows need the blue car to help them make a dash
out of the hills. Jump in, though, if you want to take
chances, and we'll go looking for that hoodoo ruby."</p>

<p>But Matt was not in so much of a hurry now. Leaning
against the side of the car, he fell into a brown
study.</p>

<p>"What's to pay?" asked McGlory. "Something else on
your mind?"</p>

<p>"Well, yes," laughed Matt; "I'd like to use you and
the blue car in baiting a trap."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, I don't mind. Grattan used me for bait in
trapping Tsan Ti, so I'm getting used to it. But what
sort of a trap is it?"</p>

<p>"If Grattan and Pardo are really following you," said
Matt, "why couldn't you go back down the road, stop
the car, and pretend you had a breakdown?"</p>

<p>"Bee-yu-ti-ful!" rapped out McGlory. "I could do all
that, pard, and Grattan and Pardo could show up and
gobble me, blue car and all. Fine! Say, you're most as
good a hand at planning as the mandarin."</p>

<p>"But suppose," supplemented Matt, "that two or three
fellows were hid in the tonneau of the car and that they
jumped out at the right moment and made things interesting
for Grattan and Pardo?"</p>

<p>McGlory lifted his clinched fist and brought it down
emphatically on the steering wheel.</p>

<p>"Speak to me about that! I might have known you
had something up your sleeve. I think it would work,
pard, but who's to hide in the tonneau? You, for one,
of course, but who else?"</p>

<p>"The farmer who lives here seems to be rather handy
and to have plenty of courage, and he's got a bulldog
that's a whole team and something to spare. I guess the
farmer, and I, and the dog will be enough."</p>

<p>"Keno! Trot out the Rube and the kyoodle and we'll
slide back down the road with a chip on our shoulder."</p>

<p>Matt went into the barn for a talk with the farmer.
He listened attentively while Matt gave him a rsum
of events and a synopsis of the plan he had evolved.</p>

<p>"I'm with yew," cried the farmer, slapping his hands,
"but yew'll have to wait till I tell Josi' where I'm goin'.
If we take the dorg away from the barn, Josi' ought to
watch these fellers till we git back."</p>

<p>"We'll put ropes on the sailor and that other Chinaman,"
said Matt, "but it will be a good idea to have
them watched, just the same."</p>

<p>The farmer got some spare halters and helped with
the tying. When it was finished, he hurried away to
find "Josi'" and to tell him what he was to do. In ten
minutes he was back, bringing a long, spare individual
clad in a "wamus" and overalls.</p>

<p>"Here's the fellers yew're to watch, Josi'," said the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
farmer, waving a hand toward Tsan Ti, Bunce, and Sam
Wing. "Don't yew let 'em git away, nuther."</p>

<p>"If they git away, by jing," answered Josi', pushing
up the sleeves of his wamus, "they'll have to walk over
me to do it. You be kerful, Zeke Boggs. 'Pears mighty
like you had the hot end o' this job."</p>

<p>"Don't yew fret none about me," answered Boggs. "I
wasn't born yestiddy."</p>

<p>He called the dog, and he, and Matt, and Tige left the
barn and crawled into the tonneau of the blue car.</p>

<p>"How far down the road am I to go, pard?" queried
McGlory, getting out to turn over the engine.</p>

<p>"Oh, a mile or two," answered Matt.</p>

<p>"Maybe there'll not be anything doing," said Joe, as
he climbed back to his seat. "Grattan and Pardo may
have become discouraged, and given up the trail. Even
if they hung to it, we'll have to wait some time for
them."</p>

<p>"They'll come," said Matt. "I never had a day pan
out so much excitement as this one has given us. Events
have been crowding our way so thick and fast that
they're not going to stop until we have a chance at
Grattan and Pardo."</p>

<p>"I'm agreeable," expanded McGlory. "Anything from
a fight to a foot race goes with <i>me</i>. After the way I
starred myself by getting lost in this little bunch of
toy mountains, I'm hungry to square myself by doing
something worth while."</p>

<p>"You've squared yourself already by getting back the
blue car," returned Matt.</p>

<p>"Not so you could notice. Tsan Ti helped me along
with that move. The chance jumped up when I wasn't
expecting it, and hit me square between the eyes. Anyone
could have turned that trick."</p>

<p>McGlory was pushing the blue car back along the
road at a lively clip. Matt stood up to look ahead, in
the vain hope of getting track of the red jewel.</p>

<p>"I know what you're looking for, pard," remarked the
cowboy, "and you're not going to find it. A good many
peculiar things have happened to-day, and no mistake;
but picking that red stone out of a couple of square miles
of country would be too uncommon. Good luck won't
strain itself to that extent. Think we're far enough?"</p>

<p>"This will do," answered Matt, and McGlory halted
the blue car in about the loneliest spot in the Catskills.</p>

<p>There was a marsh on one side of the road, bordered
with stunted trees and matted bushes. On the other
side was the timber.</p>

<p>"Maybe," suggested McGlory, "I'd better head the
car t'other way? That's how I was going when Grattan
and Pardo saw me last, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He cut short his remarks abruptly and peered off along
the road.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Joe?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>"Car coming," was the reply. "I don't reckon many
cars take this road, and it's possible Grattan and Pardo
borrowed one from somebody who wasn't looking and
are using it to hunt for the blue automobile. Lie low,
Matt, you, and Boggs, and the dog. Here's where I
begin to pretend&mdash;listen while I tinker."</p>

<p>"If we have a fight," said Boggs, as he and Matt
crouched down in the tonneau, "by gum, I want yew to
let me do my share."</p>

<p>"We'll all have plenty to do, Mr. Boggs," answered
Matt, well pleased with the farmer's spirit, "if those
fellows who are coming are the ones we're after. Don't
make a move, though, and don't let Tige loose until I
give the word."</p>

<p>Silence fell over those in the tonneau. McGlory could
be heard pottering around with a wrench, and presently
the hum of the approaching car could be heard.</p>

<p>"I don't like the looks of things," called the cowboy,
in a guarded tone, from the front of the blue car.</p>

<p>"Why not?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>"Can't tell yet. You fellows stay where you are and
keep mum."</p>

<p>The noise of the other automobile had grown to proportions
which proved that it was almost at hand. McGlory
said something, but it was impossible for Matt or
Boggs to hear what it was.</p>

<p>The other car stopped so close to the blue automobile
that the mud guards almost scraped. Matt, from the
depths of the tonneau, caught sight of a high-powered
roadster with two business-like appearing men on the
seats. But they were not Grattan and Pardo.</p>

<p>"That's the car, sure as shooting!" declared one.</p>

<p>"Get out, Gridly," said the second man, "and look at
the number."</p>

<p>Gridly jumped down from the roadster and hurried
to the rear of the touring car.</p>

<p>"We've won out, Banks!" he called. "The number's
eighty-one-two-sixty-three."</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" inquired Matt, rising in the tonneau
and looking out from under the top.</p>

<p>"Matter?" grinned Banks. "Nothin' much, only I'm
the sheriff and all you fellows are arrested. You stole
this car from Martin's garage in Catskill last night.
Jest be peaceable, and everythin' 'll be fine: but try to
make trouble and there'll be warm doings."</p>

<p>"Sufferin' Jonah!" laughed McGlory. "Wouldn't this
rattle your spurs, Matt?"</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">HOW THE TRAP WAS SPRUNG.</p>


<p>Matt remembered that Martin had said the New York
man who owned the stolen car had sent telegrams and
telephone messages all through the hills. Perhaps, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
there was any wonderment to be indulged in, it should
have been because McGlory had escaped the officers as
long as he had.</p>

<p>The king of the motor boys opened the tonneau door
and stood on the footboard, facing Banks.</p>

<p>"You've made a slight mistake, Mr. Banks," said
Matt.</p>

<p>"From your point of view," answered the sheriff, "I
guess maybe I have. There happens to be five hundred
dollars in this for me an' Gridly, though, and we ain't
takin' your word for it that there's a mistake. This car
answers the description of the one that was stolen, right
down to the number."</p>

<p>"This is the car, all right," proceeded Matt, "but we're
not the fellows who stole it."</p>

<p>"Caught with the goods," jeered Gridly, "an' then
deny the hull job! Nervy, but it won't wash."</p>

<p>"Where'd the car fall into your hands if you ain't the
ones that stole it?" asked Banks.</p>

<p>"My chum, there, got it away from the thieves."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's what your chum did, eh?"</p>

<p>"You're to get five hundred dollars for recovering the
car?" said Matt.</p>

<p>"<i>And</i> capturin' the thieves," returned Banks.</p>

<p>"Was one of the thieves supposed to be a sailor with
a green patch over one eye?"</p>

<p>Gridly and Banks must have experienced something
of a shock. For a moment they gazed at each other.</p>

<p>"Somethin' <i>was</i> said in that telegraft about a sailor
with a green patch over one eye, Banks," observed
Gridly.</p>

<p>"That's a fact," admitted Banks reflectively. "But
we've got the car and there ain't no sailor with it. I
guess that part of the telegram must have been a mistake."</p>

<p>"There's no mistake about it," said Matt. "We have
captured the sailor, and he's at the farm of Mr. Boggs,
here."</p>

<p>Matt drew to one side so the officers could see the
farmer.</p>

<p>"Well, if it ain't Boggs!" exclaimed Banks, startled.</p>

<p>"Zeke Boggs an' his brindled bulldog!" added Gridly.</p>

<p>"What the young feller says is straight goods, Banks,"
declared the farmer. "The sailor with the patch over
his eye is up to my place in the barn. Josi's watchin'
'im."</p>

<p>"What're you doin' here? That's what I want to
know,' said Banks.</p>

<p>"Come out to help these young fellers spring a trap."</p>

<p>"What sort of a trap?"</p>

<p>"Why," put in Matt, "a trap to catch two pals of the
sailor&mdash;one of them is the man who helped the sailor
take this car from Martin's garage."</p>

<p>Banks helped himself to a chew of tobacco.</p>

<p>"Jest for the sake of bein' sociable, an' gettin' at the
nub of this thing," he remarked, "you might tell us who
you are, young feller, an' what you happen to be doing
in this part of the hills?"</p>

<p>"My name's King, Matt King&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Otherwise," cut in McGlory, "Motor Matt. Maybe
you've heard of Motor Matt?"</p>

<p>"I have," said Banks; "he's been doing things around
Catskill for the last few days."</p>

<p>The sheriff passed his shrewd eyes over the king of
the motor boys as he balanced himself on the footboard.
There was nothing in the lad's appearance to indicate
that he was not telling the truth.</p>

<p>"I'm not doubting your word at all, young feller,"
remarked Banks, "but I'll feel a lot more like believing
you if you tell me about this trap you're arrangin' to
spring."</p>

<p>Matt told how McGlory had run away from the pocket,
and how Grattan and Pardo had followed him. He
finished by describing the manner in which Grattan and
Pardo were to be lured into the vicinity of the blue automobile
and captured.</p>

<p>"That sounds like a play of Motor Matt's, right
enough," said Gridly.</p>

<p>"Anyhow, I don't think it'll work," announced Banks.</p>

<p>"Why not?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>"You can't be sure Grattan and Pardo are follerin' the
car; an', if they <i>are</i> follerin', maybe they've got off the
track."</p>

<p>"That's possible, of course; but the chances for success,
though slight, are worth waiting and working for,
don't you think? If the plan fails, we'll be out nothing
but our time."</p>

<p>"Two boys, a farmer, an' a dog ain't enough to make
the play if it should come to a showdown," declared
Banks. "Gridly and I will be in on it, I guess. I'll
take this machine up the road and tuck it away in the
bushes, then I'll come back, an' Gridly an' I will crowd
into the tonneau with the rest of you. If the game
works, I'll be capturin' one of the men I'm arter; if it
don't work, then, as you say, all we'll be out is a little
time. I'll be back in a minute. Pull the crank, Gridly."</p>

<p>The roadster flashed up the road, and Matt could see
Banks forcing the machine into the bushes at the roadside.
In a little while the sheriff was back at the touring
car.</p>

<p>"The back part of that machine will be a little
crowded," said he, "but we'll have to stand it if we make
the play you've laid out, Motor Matt."</p>

<p>"Suppose you and Gridly get into the tonneau," suggested
Matt, "and leave Boggs, and me, and the dog to
hide in the bushes at the edge of the marsh? We'll be
close enough to help if anything happens, and won't
interfere with you if you should have to work in a
hurry."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>There remained in the sheriff's mind a lingering suspicion
that this idea was launched with some ulterior
purpose in view, but a look into Motor Matt's face dispelled
the unworthy thought.</p>

<p>"That's a good suggestion," said Banks. "Get in here
with me, Gridly."</p>

<p>"You'd better turn the car around, Joe," went on
Matt, as soon as the officers were in the car.</p>

<p>McGlory started the engine and threw on the reverse,
backing the blue car until he had it headed the other
way.</p>

<p>"Now we're ready for whatever's to come," said
Banks.</p>

<p>"And it can't come too quick, either," supplemented
Gridly.</p>

<p>Matt, Boggs, and the dog retired to the edge of the
marsh and made themselves comfortable among the
bushes.</p>

<p>The king of the motor boys was well pleased with
the way the encounter with the sheriff had turned out.
There had been, for a few moments, the promise of a
serious complication, but Banks had proved reasonable
and there was nothing more to worry about.</p>

<p>Matt's hope now was that Grattan and Pardo would
fall into the trap that was laid for them. If they did,
the motor boys' account with the unscrupulous Grattan
would be settled for all time. They would always have
some regrets on account of the poor old mandarin, but
after they had looked carefully over the course of Sam
Wing's flight, they would have done everything possible
to help Tsan Ti.</p>

<p>"By gum," remarked Boggs, while he and Matt were
waiting, "I never knowed yew was Motor Matt!"</p>

<p>"I didn't suppose you'd ever heard of Motor Matt,
Mr. Boggs," answered the young motorist.</p>

<p>"I take a Gardenville paper, and that had a lot to say
about what yew been doin' down to Catskill. Yew've
given things quite a stirrin' up in that town. Is that fat
chink the one that come from Chiny to get holt of the
idol's eye?"</p>

<p>"He's the one."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm s'prised; I am, for a fact! Jest to think
all this took place right on my farm! Josi' won't hardly
know what to think, and the&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Quiet in there, pard!" came the low voice of McGlory.
"They're coming."</p>

<p>"Grattan and Pardo?" returned Matt.</p>

<p>"Sure, and they walk as though they were tired. Now
I've got to rustle around and pretend to be so busy I
don't see 'em."</p>

<p>The cowboy opened the hood and fell to tinkering with
the wrench. All was quiet in the tonneau, but there was
a load of danger for Grattan and Pardo in that blue
car had they but known it!</p>

<p>Peering from the bushes, Matt and Boggs saw the
two men come swiftly and silently along the road. McGlory,
with steady nerves, kept at his work.</p>

<p>Pardo crept up behind the cowboy and caught him
suddenly about the shoulders.</p>

<p>"I guess that puts the boot on the other leg!" exulted
Pardo, drawing McGlory roughly away from the machine.</p>

<p>"The fellow that laughs last," cried Grattan, "laughs
best. You've given us a good hard run of it, McGlory,
but we just <i>had</i> to have this car. It means everything
to Pardo and me. What's the trouble with it?"</p>

<p>"Loose burr," answered the cowboy, with feigned sullenness.
"It's been bothering me ever since I left the
pocket. If it hadn't been for that, you'd never have
caught me."</p>

<p>"Probably not," said Grattan. "Small things sometimes
lead to big results. Show me the loose burr and
I'll tighten it. After that, McGlory, we'll bid you an
affectionate farewell and show these mountains our
heels."</p>

<p>"The wrench I've got isn't large enough," went on
McGlory. "You'll have to get another out of the tool
box."</p>

<p>This was a clever ruse on the cowboy's part to draw
the thief to the footboard of the car&mdash;placing him handily
for Banks and Gridly.</p>

<p>The tool box was open. Grattan, entirely unsuspicious,
went back around the side of the car and stooped
over to get the wrench.</p>

<p>The next moment Banks had thrown himself on top
of him, Gridly had dropped out the other side of the
car, McGlory had whirled on Pardo, and Matt, Boggs,
and Tige were rushing out of the bushes.</p>

<p>The trap had been sprung, and sprung so neatly that
neither Grattan nor Pardo had the slightest chance of
getting out of it or of using their firearms.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">BACK TO THE FARM.</p>


<p>The skirmish&mdash;for it amounted to little more than that&mdash;was
over with in short order.</p>

<p>Grattan resisted stoutly, but Boggs went to Banks'
assistance, while Matt and Gridly went to McGlory's.
In almost less time than it takes to tell it, handcuffs
were snapped on the wrists of the prisoners and they
were loaded into the tonneau with the two officers.</p>

<p>"It worked as slick as greased lightning, Motor Matt!"
cried the delighted sheriff. "Those two crooks never
suspected a thing!"</p>

<p>Pardo was exceedingly bitter.</p>

<p>"Now, see what your confounded plans have done for
me, Grattan!" he cried angrily. "I was a fool to ever tie
up with you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>"If we'd been successful," returned Grattan coolly
"and secured the ruby, you'd have talked the other way.
Where's your nerve, Pardo?"</p>

<p>Pardo, still dazed by the suddenness of the capture,
sank back into the corner of the tonneau, muttering.</p>

<p>"This is your work, is it, Motor Matt?" inquired Grattan,
leaning over the side of the car and fixing his gaze
on the young motorist.</p>

<p>"I helped plan it," said Matt.</p>

<p>"He was the whole works," spoke up McGlory.
"Maybe it wasn't <i>quite</i> so clever as the way you played
it on me and Tsan Ti, Grattan," and a tantalizing grin
accompanied the words; "but I reckon it'll do."</p>

<p>"The more I see and learn about Motor Matt," declared
Grattan, "the more I admire his shining abilities.
He's a wonder. We've matched wits several times, and
he's always had a shade the best of it. Will you answer
a civil question, my lad?"</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"Where's Tsan Ti and the ruby?"</p>

<p>"Tsan Ti and Bunce are at a farm near here, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So that old idiot has got tangled in the net, too!"</p>

<p>"But the ruby," finished Matt, "has been lost."</p>

<p>"Lost?" Grattan showed considerable excitement.
"How was it lost?"</p>

<p>"Sam Wing stole the ruby from Tsan Ti, on the
train, and jumped off at Gardenville. The mandarin
discovered his loss in time to leave the train at the
same station."</p>

<p>"Oh, thunder!" exclaimed Grattan disgustedly. "So
<i>that</i> was why Tsan Ti followed Sam Wing out of Gardenville!"</p>

<p>"And you thought the mandarin was afraid of you,
and that that was his reason for hot-footing it into the
hills," derided Pardo.</p>

<p>"Where and how was the ruby lost?" went on Grattan,
paying no attention to Pardo.</p>

<p>"I started out with Martin to look for this automobile,"
said Matt, "and we found Sam Wing at the
watering place on the Gardenville road. McGlory and
I followed him, but my chum got lost and I was left to
keep up the chase alone. It was somewhere along the
course Sam Wing led me that the ruby was lost."</p>

<p>"Sam Wing is fooling you!"</p>

<p>"I think he's telling the truth, Grattan."</p>

<p>"Bosh! The chink has hidden the ruby and is trying
to make you believe he lost it. If you let him go, he'll
find the stone and get away with it."</p>

<p>"Why not turn him loose, an' then follow him?" suggested
Banks.</p>

<p>Matt shook his head.</p>

<p>"I'm positive Sam Wing is giving the straight of it,"
he declared.</p>

<p>"Well," laughed Grattan, but with an undernote of
regret, "I hope he is. If I can't have the ruby that I've
worked for so long, I'm glad to think that no one else
will have it. Where are we bound for, gentlemen?" and
Grattan turned to Banks and Gridly.</p>

<p>"To the Boggs farm to pick up the sailor," Banks replied,
"then for the Catskill jail."</p>

<p>"Very pleasant outlook," observed Grattan.</p>

<p>"Can you drive a motor car, Matt?" asked Gridly.</p>

<p>"<i>Can</i> he?" exploded McGlory. "Say, pard," he added,
turning to Matt, "do you know a spark-plug from the
carburetor?"</p>

<p>"No offense," proceeded Gridly hastily. "I was only
going to ask Matt if he would bring our roadster along."</p>

<p>"Boggs and I will come in the roadster," said Matt.
"You take the blue car to the farm, Joe."</p>

<p>"On the jump, pard!" came heartily from McGlory.</p>

<p>"You motor boys are a great team!" exclaimed Banks.</p>

<p>"They're hard to beat," put in Grattan. "If it hadn't
been for them, I should have been in Paris about now,
in very comfortable circumstances."</p>

<p>Matt waited for no more, but, accompanied by Boggs
and Tige, hurried along the road to the place where
Banks had left the roadster. Matt was cranking when
McGlory whirled past on his way to the farm. Two
minutes later the roadster was crowding the touring car
hard, and Matt was honking for the cowboy to make
better time.</p>

<p>"Everybody seems to be your friend, Motor Matt,"
said Boggs, "even that there thief."</p>

<p>"Grattan is a strange fellow, Boggs," answered Matt.
"He's as talented a chap as you'll find anywhere, but
he'd rather steal for a living than work honestly."</p>

<p>"Some folks is that way," ruminated Boggs. "They'll
waste more brains an' elbow grease pullin' off a robb'ry
that'll bring 'em in a thousand dollars than they'd need
for makin' ten thousand honestly. Look at me, scrubbin'
along on a stony farm, raisin' garden truck for the
hotels, when I might go out with a drill an' a jimmy,
an'&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Make a nice comfortable home for yourself in a
stone house with iron doors and barred windows,"
laughed Matt. "There are lots of worse places than a
stony truck farm, Boggs."</p>

<p>"I guess yew're right."</p>

<p>At that moment the touring car turned in at the farmyard
and came to a halt near the barn. The roadster
followed and stopped alongside.</p>

<p>Leaving Gridly to take care of Grattan and Pardo,
Banks accompanied Matt and Boggs into the barn. Josi'
met them at the door.</p>

<p>"What luck, Zeke?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Best kind, Josi'," replied Boggs. "Got our men, too
easy for any use. The sheriff, here, and his deputy,
Gridly, come along jest in time to help. They want
one o' the prisoners we left yew to take keer of."</p>

<p>"They're all here, you bet," said Josi', with laudable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
pride. "The' wa'n't any of 'em could git away from
<i>me</i>."</p>

<p>Banks cast his eyes over the three men.</p>

<p>"What's to be done with the two Chinamen?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"I think they ought to go to Catskill, too," said Matt.</p>

<p>"We can carry the sailor in the tonneau of the big
car, and there's room for one of the Chinamen on the
seat alongside McGlory. T'other chink could go with
you, in the roadster. Which is the mandarin that got
robbed of the ruby?"</p>

<p>Matt pointed to the dejected figure of Tsan Ti.</p>

<p>"What is he roped for?" asked Banks.</p>

<p>"So he can't put himself out of the way," said Matt.
"The regent of China sent him a yellow cord, and told
him that if he did not recover the ruby in two weeks
he was please to strangle himself. I had to tie the mandarin
in that way to keep him from obeying orders."</p>

<p>Banks was not a hard-hearted man, and something in
the mandarin's plight touched him. Perhaps it was the
Celestial's hopeless air, coupled with his torn and dusty
garments.</p>

<p>The sheriff stood for a few minutes in front of Tsan
Ti, looking down at him and shaking his head.</p>

<p>"They're a queer lot, these chinks," he commented
finally. "Their ideas are not ours, by a long shot, but
I don't know as that's anything against them. Do you
want to take the mandarin with you in the roadster,
Matt?"</p>

<p>"I think I'd better."</p>

<p>Matt bent down and removed the rope from Tsan Ti's
ankles. The mandarin did not want to get up or make
a move, but Matt and Banks lifted him to his feet and
succeeded in getting him out of the barn.</p>

<p>As they stood beside the roadster, the mandarin slumping
limply in their supporting hands, a cry came from
the road.</p>

<p>"Well, by golly! If dar ain't de man whut got ole
Gin'ral Jackson back fo' me. Ah's monsus 'bliged tuh
yo', boss, Ah is, fer er fac'."</p>

<p>Matt looked around and saw the old darky ambling
toward the barn on his mule.</p>

<p>"That's Neb Hogan," spoke up Boggs. "He's got a
cabin down beyond about half a mile. Do you know
him, Motor Matt?"</p>

<p>Although old Neb Hogan did not look it, yet he was,
at that moment, engaged upon one of the most important
missions of his life.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">CONCLUSION.</p>


<p>"What can I do for you, Neb?" asked Matt, facing
the darky as he pulled his mule to a halt.</p>

<p>"Ah dunno as yo' can do nuffin' fo' me, boss," answered
Neb. "Ah reckons yo's done about all fo' dis
moke dat he can expec'. Yo' done got Gin'ral Jackson
back fo' me, an' dat odder feller found his bicycle, too.
Ah 'lows yo' must hab been in er hurry, 'case yo' didn't
wait fo' me to tell yo' Ah was obliged fo' whut yo' done.
Lucky Ah seed yo' while Ah was passin' Mars Boggs'
place. Close tuh where dat white boy found his bicycle
dar was somefin' right on de aidge o' de bridge. Ah
gaddered it in, en Ah thought mebby yo' was de one
whut drapped hit. Ah was wonderin' en mah ole head
how Ah was gwine tuh diskibber whedder what Ah
found belonged tuh you&mdash;en heah, right when Ah was
gittin' clost tuh home, Ah done sees yuh! Ain't dat
fine? Somefin' strodinary 'bout dat."</p>

<p>A faint hope was rising in Motor Matt's breast, but
it was very faint. The foundation of it was almost too
preposterous for belief.</p>

<p>"What did you find, Neb?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Ah don't know whedder hit amounts to nuffin' er not,
but Ah reckons yo' kin tell."</p>

<p>Thereupon Neb shoved one hand into a pocket of his
tattered coat and brought out, mixed in his yellow palm
with two nails, a fishline, and a piece of chewing tobacco&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>The Eye of Buddha!</i></p>

<p>It was almost sunset, and the early shadows were beginning
to fly over the eastern borders of the Catskills,
but there was enough light to strike sparkling crimson
gleams from the fateful gem that lay in the old darky's
hand.</p>

<p>"Does dat 'ar thing b'long tuh yo', boss?" said Neb
Hogan.</p>

<p>"Hold it just that way for a minute, Neb," returned
Matt.</p>

<p>Then quickly he slipped the cords from the mandarin's
wrists.</p>

<p>"Look up, Tsan Ti," went on Matt. "See here a
minute."</p>

<p>Apathetically the mandarin raised his head. His gaze
fell on the red gem, glittering amid the poor treasures
which the old negro "toted" in his pocket.</p>

<p>The mandarin's body stiffened, his hands flew to his
forehead, and he gazed spellbound; then, with a hoarse
cry, he caught the ruby from Neb's hand, pushed it
against his breast, and fell to his knees, muttering wildly
in his native tongue.</p>

<p>"Well, by thunder!" exclaimed Banks. "Is that the
idol's eye, Matt?"</p>

<p>Matt nodded.</p>

<p>"You found that red jewel at the edge of the bridge,
you say, Neb?"</p>

<p>"Dat's whar Ah done picked it up. What is dat thing,
anyhow? By golly, dat Chinymum ack lak he done
gone crazy."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's a ruby, Neb," explained Matt, "and very valuable.
The Chinaman who stole your mule had taken the ruby
away from this other Chinaman, and was trying to
escape with it. General Jackson wouldn't take the
bridge, and the Chinaman on his back kicked and pounded
him so that the mule bucked and tossed him to the edge
of the bridge. Before the Chinaman could save himself
he fell into the creek. The ruby must have dropped
out of his pocket upon the planks of the bridge. I didn't
see it, though, and it remained for you to pick it up."</p>

<p>"By golly!" breathed Neb. "Ain't dat a mos' 'sprisin'
purceedin'? Ah done finds de ruby fo' de feller whut
got mah mu-el back fo' me. Is we squar' now, boss?"</p>

<p>"Square?" laughed Matt. "Why, Neb, we're a whole
lot more than square. How much do you think that
ruby's worth?"</p>

<p>"Kain't be hit's worf mo' dan ten dollahs, I reckons,"
he guessed.</p>

<p>"It's worth thousands of dollars, Neb!"</p>

<p>"Go 'long wif yo' foolishness! Dat red thing kain't
be worf all dat money, nohow. Yo's foolin' de pore
ole moke."</p>

<p>"It's the truth, Neb."</p>

<p>Tsan Ti, jabbering wildly, arose from his bended knees
and pulled his alligator-skin pouch from his blouse.</p>

<p>"Excellent stranger of the dusky race," said he, "I
gather from what I hear that I am in your debt for the
recovery of the Eye of Buddha. Will it insult you if I
offer, of my goodness of heart, five hundred dollars?"</p>

<p>Neb Hogan nearly fell from General Jackson's back.</p>

<p>"Whut's dat he's er-sayin' tuh me?" he asked, rolling
up the whites of his eyes. "Talkin' 'bout five&mdash;five hunnerd
dollahs, en 'bout insultin' me wif it. By golly, Ah's
brack, but Ah don't 'low no yalluh trash tuh mek spo't
ob me. Somebody hole mah mu-el twill Ah climb down.
Five hunnerd dollahs! Ah won't 'low no Chinymun tuh
say no such thing. Ah&mdash;Ah&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Words died on the old negro's lips. Tsan Ti had
pushed a bundle of money up in front of his face, and
Neb was gazing at the bills like one demented.</p>

<p>"Accept of my gratitude, illustrious one," chanted the
mandarin. "You are worthy&mdash;it is little enough."</p>

<p>The darky tried to talk, but the words stuck in his
throat. Mechanically he took the bills, smoothed them
out in his hands, and finally pushed them into his pocket.</p>

<p>"Ah reckons dishyer's a dream," he managed to gasp
finally. "Ah reckons Ah'll wake up tuh heah Mandy
buildin' de fiah fo' breakfus. Eider dat, or Ah's suah
gone crazy."</p>

<p>Then, turning General Jackson, Neb Hogan rode out
of the gate, looking back fearfully as long as he was
in sight, wondering, no doubt, if those he had left were
not the phantoms of his disordered imagination.</p>

<p>This little scene had been enacted under the eyes of
McGlory and the prisoners in the blue touring car. Grattan's
feelings, perhaps, may be imagined better than
described. McGlory was "stumped," as he would have
expressed it.</p>

<p>"Now that Tsan Ti has got the ruby again, pard,"
called the cowboy, "I move we pack him in a box, idol's
eye and all, and turn him over to the express company
for safe transportation to Canton. If we don't, something
is sure going to happen to him."</p>

<p>"Nothing will happen to him now," said Matt. "The
men he had to fear are in the custody of the law, and
from now on Tsan Ti will experience no more trouble."</p>

<p>"Esteemed friend," palpitated the overjoyed mandarin,
"I shall yet deposit the ruby in the express company's
care as soon as I get to Catskill. The lessons I have
had are sufficient."</p>

<p>"That's the talk!" approved the cowboy.</p>

<p>"What shall we do with Sam Wing?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>For an instant a flash of rage drove the happiness
from the mandarin's eyes. But the flash died as swiftly
as it came.</p>

<p>"Have you a knife, illustrious youth?" inquired the
mandarin.</p>

<p>"Better keep it, pard!" warned McGlory. "Tsan Ti's
going to do for Wing!"</p>

<p>But Matt believed otherwise. Taking his knife from
his pocket, he handed it to Tsan Ti and the latter went
into the barn. He reappeared in a few moments, and
Sam Wing, freed of his ropes, accompanied him.</p>

<p>Harsh words in Chinese broke from Tsan Ti's lips.
He talked for perhaps two minutes steadily, the harshness
leaving his voice as the torrent of speech flowed
on. When he had finished, he reached into his alligator-skin
pouch, brought out some money, and placed it in
Sam Wing's hand; then, sternly, he pointed toward the
road.</p>

<p>"What a fool!" growled Grattan.</p>

<p>"Why didn't he send the thief over the road?" muttered
Pardo.</p>

<p>"Speak to me about this!" cried McGlory.</p>

<p>"Looks like there was a few things we could learn
from the chinks," pondered Banks.</p>

<p>"You're right, Mr. Banks," said Matt. "Tsan Ti is
the right sort, and I'm glad I did what I could to help
him. Let's start for Catskill&mdash;I suppose Martin is back
there, by this time, and wondering what has become of
Joe and me. Ready for New York in the morning,
Joe?"</p>

<p>"I'm ready," was the prompt response, "but will we
go?"</p>

<p>"I believe we will," said Matt, climbing into the roadster.
"We've seen the last of the hoodoo. Get in, Tsan
Ti, and we'll hit it up between here and Catskill. You're
to ride with me."</p>

<h2><a name="HUDSON_AND_THE_NORTHWEST_PASSAGE" id="HUDSON_AND_THE_NORTHWEST_PASSAGE">HUDSON AND THE NORTHWEST PASSAGE.</a></h2>


<p>A short time ago the newspapers announced that a feat
which for four hundred years stout ships and bold crews
have been attempting had been accomplished by a little Norwegian
vessel of forty tons and seven men.</p>

<p>Long ago, the news would have thrilled the harbors of
England and Holland with joy and keen expectancy. Coming
in the twentieth century, it has created little sensation.
Perhaps, of all those who read the announcement, only the
few to whom "the Northwest Passage" was a name full of
history and heroism and romance realized what an interesting
achievement had been made. For the practical value of
the discovery had long since been discounted, and no "merchant
adventurer" of the present day would have sunk half
his fortune in equipping an expedition to solve the riddle
that puzzled the brains of the men of long ago.</p>

<p>For the search for the Northwest Passage was from the
first a business affair. It was a mercantile question. The
whole inquiry arose out of a trade competition between the
northern and southern seafaring nations.</p>

<p>This was the situation: Spain and Portugal had been first
in the field, as regards over-sea discovery; they had found
the way to the treasure house of Asia, and the unspoiled
riches of the New World. The Portuguese held the monopoly
of maritime trade with India&mdash;the Venetians had long
governed the overland route, and grown wealthy thereby&mdash;and
the Spaniards looked upon South America as their private
property.</p>

<p>Of the two, the Spanish settlements on the American
coasts with the mines behind them drew the eyes of the
adventurer, who secured his prizes at the sword's point, but
Asia was the more tempting to the trader. The former
dreamed of the sack of opulent cities; the latter dreamed of
bustling wharves, and barter, and English ships coming home
laden with spices and silks, the peaceful spoils of the market
place and the tropical forest and the shark-haunted seas.</p>

<p>How to reach India "by a quick route, without crossing the
sea paths of the Portuguese and the Spaniards," this, in a
word, was the origin of the long and arduous search for
the Northwest Passage.</p>

<p>It was the general belief that America was an island, but
the size and shape of it was still only imperfectly known.
That there was a water way round the southern end of the
great continent had been proved by Magellan, who, in his
voyage round the world, had passed through the straits that
bear his name. The question now was, did a similar waterway
exist at the northern end?</p>

<p>They believed that America tapered to a point northward,
as it did southward. They little realized how the northern
continent spread itself out into the cold Arctic seas, and
with what a network of islands and ice floes it ended.</p>

<p>And so they sent out ships to search for a water way
through those inhospitable seas, and the first to go was an
Englishman, Martin Frobisher.</p>

<p>Greatly did he dare. We in these days of perfectly appointed
ships, built of steel and driven by steam, can appreciate
the hardihood of this hero and his crews, setting forth
in two tiny craft of twenty-five and twenty tons burden, respectively,
to solve the riddle of the northern seas! They
sailed away&mdash;Queen Elizabeth herself waving them adieu
from the windows of her palace at Greenwich&mdash;on June 12th,
1576, and a month later they were off the coast of Greenland.</p>

<p>Then came stormy weather. A pinnace with her crew of
four was sunk, and Frobisher found himself alone&mdash;one ship
among the never-ending ice. For his consort had gone
home, discouraged by the forbidding outlook.</p>

<p>But almost immediately after this disappointment there
came a gleam of hope. He beheld what appeared to be a
passageway trending westward. It seems that this is still
called Frobisher Bay. As he sailed through he thought that
he had Asia on one side and America on the other. It was
but a happy delusion. The projecting corner of Asia was
far away; he was only abreast of what has since been named
Baffin's Land.</p>

<p>Frobisher's second voyage, made in 1577, was rather a
gold quest than a journey of discovery. A lump of stone
(probably iron pyrites) had been brought home by one of
the sailors as a souvenir of the first voyage. The particles
of gold in it fired the fancies of some Londoners with the
idea that Eldorado might perhaps, after all, be among the
northern ice.</p>

<p>So Frobisher's ships went out again, and brought home
something like 200 tons of the black stone. A third time
they made the voyage, no less than fifteen ships taking part
in the expedition, the object of which was to establish a sort
of settlement for the working of the supposed "gold mine."
But nothing came of the attempt. Bewildering fogs and
perilous storms and threatening icebergs beset the puny
fleet; sickness followed hard upon the exposure and privations
long endured by the poor fellows who manned it, and
at last the scheme was abandoned.</p>

<p>Yet in this disappointing third voyage Frobisher had unknowingly
come very near the discovery which originally
he had in view! For, in the words of the writer before
quoted, "the truth was that Frobisher's foremost ships had
got farther to the south than was realized, and unwittingly
he had discovered what is now known as Hudson's Strait&mdash;the
sea gate of that very Northwest Passage on which his
waking and sleeping thoughts so long had brooded."</p>

<p>He had been carried some sixty leagues up the strait, but
as he knew nothing as to whither it led he reaped no advantage.</p>

<p>Several years went by without another attempt being
made to solve the problem, of the Northwest Passage, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
at last, in the summer of 1585, some English merchants
planned a fresh expedition.</p>

<p>Two ships were fitted out&mdash;one the <i>Sunshine</i>, of London,
fifty tons; the other the <i>Moonshine</i>, of Dartmouth, thirty-five
tons. The command was intrusted to a young Devonshire
sailor, Captain John Davis, whose name is familiar to all
schoolboys who have drawn maps of the northern parts of
North America.</p>

<p>Though the records of the voyage abound with incidents
relating to the various encounters that Davis' men had with
spouting whales and basking seals, uncouth Eskimos, and
Polar bears, the actual achievements of this expedition were
not great. The ships traversed part of what is now called
Davis Strait, and went some way up Cumberland Gulf, but
by the end of September they were back in Dartmouth.</p>

<p>Davis set forth again, next summer, with three ships and
a pinnace. The latter and one of the ships were dispatched
up the east coast of Greenland, while the commander, with
the two other vessels, sailed northwest. He got as far as
Hudson Strait and farther. And in a third voyage he
reached a headland not far from Upernavik. The hardihood
and pluck displayed in these attempts to penetrate the
ice-encumbered seas were splendid, but the results did not
throw much light on the question of how to get northwest
by sea to the Indies.</p>

<p>Soon after this the kindred question of a Northeast Passage
forced itself upon the seafaring people of Holland, and
the city of Amsterdam fitted out four ships, and sent them
forth under William Barents, in the June of 1594. The story
of this and subsequent expeditions cannot, however, be told
here, though it is full of heroism and strange adventures.</p>

<p>It was the idea of a Northeast route which first laid hold
of Henry Hudson, the intrepid Englishman whose name
figures so prominently on the map of North America. Like
Barents, he made his way to Nova Zembla, but, baffled by
the seemingly insuperable difficulties to the eastward, he
turned westward in his third voyage, and again when he
set forth on his fourth and last voyage.</p>

<p>Some of his men were evidently less stout of heart than
their commander, and when there began to be real prospects
of being caught in the ice, the spirit of mutiny got the
upper hand. On June 21st, 1610, with a cowardice that
was happily in strange contrast to the usual behavior of
English crews, it was decided to get rid of the captain. Next
morning he and his little son, a loyal-hearted sailor (the
ship's carpenter), and half a dozen sick and helpless members
of the crew, were put over the ship's side into one of
the boats, and left to their fate.</p>

<p>The years went by. Other expeditions were fitted out and
sent northward, but the old reasons for finding out the Northwest
Passage were fast disappearing. The Portuguese monopoly
of the sea-borne trade with India and the supremacy
of Spain on the ocean highways were things of the past.
The ships of other nations had no longer to skulk past these
aforetime kings of the sea.</p>

<p>Arctic exploration went on, but the idea of reaching the
North Pole was beginning to take the place of the idea of
"making" the Northwest Passage. That old problem, however,
was in prospect of being solved by the attempts made
to solve the former. So that by the year 1853 Collinson was
able to sail so far that he came within fifty-seven miles&mdash;a
mere pin prick on the map&mdash;of accomplishing the Northwest
Passage.</p>

<p>Finally, in 1906, the Passage, which, like a mountain tunnel,
had been worked at from both ends, was penetrated from
one opening to the other by the little <i>Gja</i>, a Norwegian
sloop of forty tons, which sailed from Christiania on June
1st, 1903.</p>

<p>She was under the command of Captain Roald Amundsen,
of that city, and his right-hand man was Lieutenant Godfred
Hansen, of the Danish navy; the crew numbered seven. She
had not been built with a view to Arctic work, so that
before she went north into the realm of the ice king she had
to be fortified somewhat. An ice sheathing of two-inch oak
planks added greatly to her resisting power, and her petroleum
motor of 13 horse power enabled her, when she put
to sea, to attain a traveling speed of three knots in smooth
water. But the <i>Gja</i> trusted chiefly, like the stout little barks
of other days, to the skillful handling of her sails.</p>

<p>The winters of 1903 and 1904 were spent in harbor on the
shores of King William's Land. Only the premature closing
in of the ice prevented the little vessel from achieving the
Passage in 1905.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_DEATH_BITE" id="THE_DEATH_BITE">THE DEATH BITE.</a></h2>


<p>"Well, Ed, let us hear from you to-night. You are always
talking of strategy, flanks, and other soldiering knickknacks.
Now tell us a story."</p>

<p>The boys drew their chairs about the roaring fire, which
cast its ruddy glow about the room, while without the north
wind held revelry in the branches of the trees.</p>

<p>Ed looked over the top of his paper, and smiled.</p>

<p>"What's that you say, Bib? I can't tell much of a story."</p>

<p>Ed drew his chair to the fire. A chorus of supplications
came from all parts of the room, and Ed laid aside his paper.</p>

<p>"In the early spring of 1863 we were encamped near the
Pamunky River, about the time they were undermining the
enemy's fort on the other side of the river. One rainy night
a party of us were formed and marched out. It was well
known the enemy was not far off, and I felt anything but
pleasant. The rain poured down in a deluge, and we picked
our way through the woods by the blinding flashes of lightning
which now and then illumined the forest. The heavy
rains had transformed the ground into a swamp. Near the
edge of the forest we halted and separated in squads of five.</p>

<p>"By good luck I had charge of one squad. From under
our overcoats we drew our spades and waited for the rain to
slack.</p>

<p>"'Now, Ed,' said the lieutenant, 'you take your men and
select a spot and dig a rifle pit, and if anything comes in
your way bang away at it, for things are getting hot.'</p>

<p>"A few minutes more and the lieutenant and his party were
gone. Between two huge trees we began to dig, and in a few
hours we had finished our pit. The boys tumbled in and all
were soon asleep, except Barry; he was a down-Easter and
had been through most of the campaigns.</p>

<p>"The rain ceased falling, and no sound reached us save the
pattering raindrops as the wind dislodged them from the
trees.</p>

<p>"I had scarcely taken forty winks, when Barry poked me
in the ribs. I awoke immediately.</p>

<p>"'Look there!' he whispered.</p>

<p>"I looked over the pit and saw a small light swaying to and
fro. I thought at first it was a will-o'-the-wisp.</p>

<p>"'Will I fire at it?' asked Barry.</p>

<p>"'You know your orders, don't you?' I replied. 'Let us
both fire at it.' Both of our muskets were shoved over the
top of the pit, and taking a hasty aim, we fired.</p>

<p>"A loud yell followed the reports, and we saw the light
fly upward and fall to the ground; then all was darkness, and
the same quietness returned.</p>

<p>"'I wonder is he dead?' was the question that arose; and
then the boys returned to their corners and slumbered on.</p>

<p>"Soon the faint gray streaks of morning began to light
up the east; and as I felt very thirsty I took my canteen, and
clambered out of the pit, and started off. A few minutes'
walk brought me to a small creek, and I filled my canteen
and stooped to drink. The snapping of a twig caused me to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
look up; and my hair fairly raised, for not two yards from
me stood a powerful man dressed in gray; he had pistols,
a musket and an ugly-looking toothpick. A low chuckle
came from his lips, and I gave myself up for lost, as I had
not even so much as a penknife with me. In my eagerness to
get water I forgot all. The Confederate seemed to read me
through, for he said:</p>

<p>"'Well, Yank, have you got enough water?'</p>

<p>"I managed to say 'Yes'.</p>

<p>"'Well,' he said, 'get away from here, and think yourself
lucky.'</p>

<p>"It did not take me long to get away from that spot. Then
I noticed, for the first time, that our pit was dug on the top
of a little hill. A few yards off on the other side of the creek
stood a large barn. I could see forms walking about from
where I now stood. The man I had met walked toward the
barn. The boys in the pit saw him, and the muzzles of their
guns frowned over the top in a minute. At that moment a
detachment of men came to relieve us. They had hardly
reached us, when from behind the barn a party of soldiers
hove in sight, dragging a small fieldpiece, and in a moment
more a crashing iron ball came tearing in our midst. With
whoops and yells the enemy dashed on our little party, and
we were soon engaged hand to hand. I felt myself hurled to
the ground and a hand tightening about my throat. Then the
fear of death stole upon me, and the strength of a Hercules
took possession of my limbs. I turned my assailant over and
placed my knee on his breast.</p>

<p>"In vain I looked about for something to put an end to the
struggling man whom I held, but could find nothing. In
his belt I saw the handle of a knife. I seized it with one
hand, but in doing so my grasp relaxed upon his throat, and
before I could prevent it he had my finger in his mouth,
and his teeth closed upon it. I fairly howled with pain and
drove the knife into his heart several times. His jaws grew
rigid in death and his teeth cut slowly to the bone and partly
bit that, too. How I yelled! If it had been taken off at once
the pain would have been nothing, but being bitten slowly off
was intense. I had to pry open his jaws with the knife to get
my finger out of his mouth."</p>

<p>Ed paused and the boys crowded about him, and the second
finger was minus an inch. We all dispersed that night thinking
there has been many an adventure that befell the brave
boys of which the public will never know anything.</p>

<h2><a name="MIGRATION_OF_RATS" id="MIGRATION_OF_RATS">MIGRATION OF RATS.</a></h2>


<p>In nearly all countries a seasonal movement of rats from
houses and barns to the open fields occurs in spring, and the
return movement takes place as cold weather approaches.
The movement is noticeable even in large cities.</p>

<p>More general movements of rats often occur. In 1903 a
multitude of migrating rats spread over several counties of
western Illinois. They were noticed especially in Mercer and
Rock Island Counties. For several years prior to this invasion
no abnormal numbers were seen, and their coming
was remarkably sudden. An eye-witness to the phenomenon
informed the writer that as he was returning to his home by
moonlight he heard a general rustling in the field near by,
and soon a vast army of rats crossed the road in front of him,
all going in one direction. The mass stretched away as far
as could be seen in the dim light. These animals remained
on the farms and in the villages of the surrounding country,
and during the winter and summer of 1904 were a veritable
plague. A local newspaper stated that between March 20
and April 20, 1904, F. U. Montgomery, of Premption, Mercer
County, killed three thousand four hundred and thirty-five
rats on his farm. He caught most of them in traps.</p>

<p>In 1877 a similar migration occurred into parts of Saline
and Lafayette Counties, Mo., and in 1904 another came under
the writer's observation in Kansas River Valley. This valley
for the most part was flooded by the great freshet of June,
1903, and for about ten days was covered with several feet
of water. It is certain that most of the rats in the valley
perished in this flood. In the fall of 1903 much of the district
was visited by hordes of rats, which remained during
the winter, and by the following spring had so increased in
numbers that serious losses of grain and poultry resulted.</p>

<p>No doubt the majority of the so-called migrations of rodents
are in reality instances of unusual reproduction or of
enforced migration owing to lack of food. In England a
general movement of rats inland from the coast occurs every
October. This is closely connected with the closing of the
herring season. During the fishing the rodents swarm to the
coast, attracted by the offal left from cleaning the herring,
and when this food supply fails they hasten back to the farms
and villages.</p>

<p>In South America periodic plagues of rats have taken place
in Parana, Brazil, at intervals of about thirty years, and in
Chili at intervals of from fifteen to twenty-five years. These
plagues in the cultivated lands follow the ripening and decay
of the dominant species of bamboo in each country. The
ripening of the seed furnishes for two or more years a
favorite food for rats in the forests, where the animals multiply
greatly; when this food fails they are forced to the
cultivated districts for subsistence. In 1878 almost the entire
crops of corn, rice, and mandioca in the State of Parana were
destroyed by rats, causing a serious famine.</p>

<p>An invasion of black rats in the Bermuda Islands occurred
about the year 1615. In a space of two years they had increased
so alarmingly that none of the islands was free from
them. The rodents devoured everything which came in their
way&mdash;fruit, plants, and even trees&mdash;so that for two years the
people were destitute of bread. A law was passed requiring
every man in the islands to set twelve traps. In spite of all
efforts the animals increased, until they finally disappeared
with a suddenness which could have resulted only from a
pestilence.</p>

<h2><a name="SOME_GREAT_CATASTROPHES" id="SOME_GREAT_CATASTROPHES">SOME GREAT CATASTROPHES.</a></h2>


<p>"It is the general opinion that earthquakes constitute the
most terrible of the world's catastrophes, both as regards
loss of life and destruction of property," says an English
writer. "This, however, is not so. The convulsion in southern
Italy killed not less than two hundred thousand people,
and in this respect it is easily the most dreadful occurrence
of its kind. The historic Lisbon earthquake, which ranks
next below it in regard to the number of fatalities, caused
fifty thousand deaths in that one city alone and about an
equal number elsewhere. The South American one of 1867
was responsible for thirty thousand. That which destroyed
Aleppo in 1822 slew twenty thousand. These are the four
worst earthquakes concerning which anything like reliable
statistics are obtainable, and the total combined loss of life,
it will be observed, did not, at any rate, exceed three hundred
and fifty thousand.</p>

<p>"But when the Yellow River burst its banks in September,
1887, more than seven million people were drowned in the
resultant great flood, which covered to an average depth of
six feet a populous Chinese province the size of Scotland.
Thus, in this one catastrophe, more lives were lost than in all
the earthquakes recorded in the world's history. Then, again,
there is pestilence. The black death killed in China, where
it broke out, thirteen million people; in the rest of Asia,
twenty-four million, and thirty million in Europe, or sixty-seven
million in all. In India alone, and that within the
past twelve years, bubonic plague has slain over six million
people, and the epidemic still rages.</p>

<p>"Famines run plagues a close second. The one that raged
in Bombay and Madras in 1877 slew five million people; and
that which prevailed in northern China in the same year, and
which was due to the same climatic causes, cost nine million
five hundred thousand lives."</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
